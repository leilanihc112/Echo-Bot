1.4321E+17,Only Nia is welsh
1.4321E+17,Rex is scottish
1.96734E+17,I think they just kinda ran with the fact that XC1 used the UK dub when it got localized to the US
1.4321E+17,And the north american dub for XCX was shit

3.07631E+17,hey
3.07631E+17,xcx was cool... for a bit
1.4321E+17,XCX had some enjoyable bits
3.07631E+17,just kill the music after a couple of loops and disregard the story for the most part
3.07631E+17,"actually, the story was okay... but only sometimes"
1.4321E+17,"How to make the plot more enjoyable:
Remove tatsu"
1.4321E+17,Also remove the player character tbh
1.4321E+17,Added nothing to the story
1.96734E+17,I'm joking (mostly)
1.96734E+17,Might have to dust off the Wii U
1.96734E+17,Homebrew for it is supposedly pretty sick
1.4321E+17,Can you bring the tit slider back?

1.96734E+17,Oh no
1.4321E+17,In japan
1.96734E+17,Of course
1.4321E+17,It got removed from the NA version
1.96734E+17,Good thing Smash Ultimate is only for good boys and girls
1.4321E+17,And gamers were upset about muh censorship
1.96734E+17,That's like how they animated the bounce out of Mai's sprites in the western KOF ports
2.22167E+17,"XCX removes titty slider. XC2 adds GIANT tits. Ok, Nintendo"
1.96734E+17,I guess that's why Pyra and Rex only got in as Lucina and shulk recolors
1.96734E+17,"Also damn, is xc2 two years old already?"
1.4321E+17,Yeah almost
1.96734E+17,Wow

1.81573E+17,Damn that Osakan dialect. They sound like some kind of southern plantation owners
1.96734E+17,I forgot about Dahlia
1.96734E+17,she sounds like that one character from Dead or Alive
1.96734E+17,The biggest difference between XC1 and XC2 is that you can't play XC2 with family in the room

1.4321E+17,What style are you using?
1.96734E+17,but the 2nd phase was too hard
1.96734E+17,swordmaster mostly but switched to trickster for that fight
1.96734E+17,because the dodge roll wasn't cutting it
1.4321E+17,üëå

1.4321E+17,Oh I'm terrible with it lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.4321E+17,Gotta abuse iframes to make it easier
1.4321E+17,If you jump or roll through an attack then block or release it's always a perfect one
1.4321E+17,So I'd just find the attacks I was comfortable dodging through then block during the jump
1.96734E+17,that sounds a lot nicer than what I did lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.4321E+17,Yeah then when they do their double dive thing and you have meter to spare you use release and fuck them up

1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN doom eternal is pretty fun so far
1.4321E+17,Not too big on the chainsaw like being mandatory at the start tho
1.4321E+17,Ammo capacity is really low to start
1.4321E+17,Shotgun holds like 16 shells and the heavy rifle holds 60
1.96734E+17,Oh nice
1.96734E+17,I kinda like low ammo reserves in shooters
1.96734E+17,Encourages mixing up weapon choices
1.4321E+17,It's nice but like at the very start it's like you dump the shotgun and swap to the rifle then you have to chainsaw after a couple of demons
1.96734E+17,Sounds like DooM II lmao

1.4321E+17,It's really fun dude

1.4321E+17,Also chainsaw spam is encouraged in eternal
1.96734E+17,Does it still work like doom 2016?
1.4321E+17,If you're out of fuel you regen 1 tank
1.96734E+17,Oh nice
1.4321E+17,I think it gives slightly less ammo
1.4321E+17,But you can spam it and anything larger than an imp requires 3 tanks no matter what
1.96734E+17,Oh to balance using it more
1.96734E+17,Instead of refilling your entire inventory lma0
1.4321E+17,Except for marauders and doom hunters I think
1.4321E+17,Fuck marauders
1.96734E+17,Are they the arch-vile type enemy for this game?

1.4321E+17,Did you see the weird hell dudes with battle axes in the trailers?
1.96734E+17,No
1.4321E+17,They're humanoid dudes with argent battle axes and they can't be cheesed
1.4321E+17,They're immune to damage besides when their eyes glow green before certain attacks
1.4321E+17,So you have to bait out their super aggressive rushdowns and blast them
1.4321E+17,Also no rune to get armor on glory kills or infinite ammo if above certain armor threshold
1.4321E+17,You get armor by burning enemies and killing them
1.4321E+17,The only thing I really don't like about the story is that they retconned Doom Slayer into actually getting god like powers
1.4321E+17,"Instead of it just being ""he's really angry"" it's now ""he's really angry and he has god like strength and stuff"""
1.96734E+17,Wow
1.96734E+17,I was worried they were gonna do some weird lore shit
1.4321E+17,It's pretty cool overall still
1.96734E+17,"Like ""local man literally too angry to die"" is totally sufficient lool"
1.4321E+17,They explore more of the other worlds and dimensions besides hell
1.4321E+17,Also I think his name is still supposed to be Doomguy :ay:
1.96734E+17,Not *Flynn Taggart*?
1.4321E+17,He has like 2 lines of dialog in the whole game and the subtitles call him Doomguy
1.96734E+17,Lma0
1.96734E+17,"You should check out the ""Doom Bible"""
1.4321E+17,You know how there were the night sentinel dudes mentioned in the 2016
1.96734E+17,Tom Hall wanted Doom 1 to be this absurdly deep space RPG
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.4321E+17,They just kinda find Doomguy randomly in their world
1.4321E+17,And he's just mumbling the rip and tear quote from the comic
1.96734E+17,lool
1.96734E+17,**_YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS_**
1.4321E+17,Final boss fight was kinda not good imo
1.4321E+17,Too many mobs on top of the boss shaking the arena
1.4321E+17,:RIPANDTEAR:
1.4321E+17,Also you can get the classic doom guy skin
1.96734E+17,Blessed Doom comic
1.96734E+17,"Damn, he thicc"
1.96734E+17,That's a thicc-ass boi
1.4321E+17,The retcon of him being super stronk is kinda dumb but the game is still 100% worth it
1.96734E+17,I'll have to get it when I upgrade lma0
1.96734E+17,My hardware struggled a bit with 2016
1.4321E+17,Because I preordered through amazon I had to install it through the bethesda launcher
6.00007E+17,launch 'er? I hardly know 'er!
1.4321E+17,Let me know if you ever just wanna use that
1.96734E+17,Oh boy
1.96734E+17,I keep forgetting Bethesda owns id or something now
1.96734E+17,That reminds me of when you go to Pritchard's office in Deus Ex HR
1.4321E+17,Zenimax bought out Id and Zenimax owns bethesda
1.96734E+17,and there's a final fantasy poster on the wall
1.96734E+17,Because SqEnix
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,But it's for a fictional FF that exists only in the DX universe lma0
1.4321E+17,Oh yeah they somehow made the super shotgun even better
6.00007E+17,bett 'er? I hardly know 'er!
1.96734E+17,"Grapple, right?"
1.4321E+17,The grapple is amazing but the master upgrade for it is absurd
1.4321E+17,Burning enemies drop armor and explode into more armor when killed
1.4321E+17,And when you get the last upgrade the grapple ignites enemies
1.4321E+17,So you just grapple in and nuke enemies for a huge chunk of armor
1.4321E+17,They buffed shotgun's grenades too
1.4321E+17,They're sticky grenades and you can fire 3 before reloading it
1.96734E+17,Fuc
1.4321E+17,Then it goes up to 5
2.22167E+17,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tftR8up07G4

2.22167E+17,And Zato bringing the Leather Club back
2.22167E+17,Still waiting on Bridget. I'm worried that I might turn straight if he doesn't return
6.00007E+17,"Hi worried that I might turn straight if he doesn't return, I'm Terminus!"
5.00413E+17,Alyx is pretty good so far
6.00007E+17,https://i.redd.it/qr97nfztrkjx.gif
1.96734E+17,I bet
1.96734E+17,tfw no VR so no half life
1.96734E+17,I'll have to stick to Black Mesa since it's finally finished
5.00413E+17,"big rip. The only other FPS VR game I've played gives me mad motion sickness, so I was worried"
5.00413E+17,but you can set the movement to be teleport based so that's not a problem at all
1.96734E+17,oh nice
1.96734E+17,I figured that was the default for most VR FPS
5.00413E+17,"I've played a little boneworks, which has movement like blade & sorcery. It's not to bad in B&S because you have a limited arena space and don't really have to move too much, but it's pretty rough in boneworks. I might get used to it, I've only played a couple of times. But it's rough for now"
1.96734E+17,damn
1.96734E+17,I have terrible motion sickness
1.96734E+17,beat-my-meatsaber was pretty cool though
5.00413E+17,Yeah beatsaber I have no problems with
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,stationary games are fine
1.96734E+17,blade and sorcery fucked me up though
5.00413E+17,"and superhot VR was made exquisitely for VR, It's a great combat game but you stay totally stationary"
1.96734E+17,that sounds sick
1.96734E+17,superhot looked cool
5.00413E+17,"yeah, I bought the whole bundle of superhot games when I got my VR set. They're all really good, but superhot VR was insanely good"
5.00413E+17,"It makes you feel like an action hero, dual wielding sub-machine guns and shit"
1.96734E+17,fuck ye
1.96734E+17,I need more actiony games
5.00413E+17,I'd say superhot is worth getting
1.96734E+17,"yeah, I'll probably pick it up eventually"
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN I just realized that you're the same guy from OG doom to eternal
1.4321E+17,"I thought it was because I was wearing the OG skin that it showed someone holding the OG boomer doom helmet, but it shows that in the flashback regardless of the skin you have on"
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,DooM 64 is what kicks off the lore memery
1.96734E+17,because you stay in hell forever to murder demons
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,"Also apparently the doom slayer had the super powers already in 2016, but I missed that codex :ay:"
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,he's a gigachad
4.94592E+17,Fat kill count

1.4321E+17,Oh fuck
1.4321E+17,You can start the new XCDE epilogue stuff immediately upon starting the game
1.96734E+17,?
1.4321E+17,There's an expanded epilogue in the xenoblade remake
1.96734E+17,oh
1.96734E+17,is it out??
1.4321E+17,Nah
1.4321E+17,May 29th
1.96734E+17,ah
1.96734E+17,sick
1.4321E+17,Also fashion slots are being added so you can use naked dunban and not make every cutscene gachi
1.4321E+17,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVfMySwUibQ

1.4321E+17,I'm ready to do like a third playthrough of XC
6.00007E+17,"Hi ready to do like a third playthrough of XC, I'm Terminus!"
1.4321E+17,And it means we can get an HD version of this
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,and finally no JPEG eyes
1.4321E+17,Oh shit
1.4321E+17,Alvis has an aegis crystal around his neck now
1.4321E+17,Nice fix to go with the change in XC2
1.96734E+17,too bad alvis doesn't have mega-tiddies
1.4321E+17,rip
1.96734E+17,not consistent with XC2 lore
1.96734E+17,smh my head

6.00007E+17,"Hi disappointed that the Xenoblade franchise removed so much gay with each sequel, I'm Terminus!"
2.22167E+17,The Monado was a metaphor for Shulk's raging cock

6.00007E+17,"Hi trying but it's all I got, I'm Terminus!"
1.96734E+17,oh NO
2.22167E+17,Why is some big titty redhead from a weeb game also named Shulk?
2.22167E+17,This is also making it harder
6.00007E+17,hard 'er? I hardly know 'er!
2.22167E+17,"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him"
1.4321E+17,apparently the HL Alyx ending confirms a new game with the ending
2.22167E+17,Half-Life 2.87878787
5.00413E+17,Yeah HL3 absolutely confirmed
5.00413E+17,I'm hoping for a HL3 for PC with Gordon as the protagonist and a HL Alyx 2 for VR
6.00007E+17,"Hi hoping for a HL3 for PC with Gordon as the protagonist and a HL Alyx 2 for VR, I'm Terminus!"
5.00413E+17,But we'll see what happens
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN i tried the multiplayer in doom eternal
1.4321E+17,it's not properly balanced :ay:
1.96734E+17,who would have thought
1.96734E+17,when Doom 2016 multiplayer was so *polished*
1.4321E+17,Yeah having no hitscan enemies in the game then deciding to make a mode with 2 demons vs the slayer
6.00007E+17,slay 'er? I hardly know 'er!
1.4321E+17,It's really one sided for the slayer
6.00007E+17,slay 'er? I hardly know 'er!
1.96734E+17,!die
6.00007E+17,"aight, I'm finna head out..."
1.96734E+17,RIP
1.96734E+17,does it have traditional multiplayer?
1.4321E+17,Just the demons vs slayer mode
1.4321E+17,I hope they just add regular frag matches
1.4321E+17,I wanna get yeeted on by some boomers
1.96734E+17,lool
1.96734E+17,that would be fun
1.96734E+17,2016 multiplayer was kinda dumb-fun
1.96734E+17,if it didn't die so quickly
1.4321E+17,Also like the slayer's weapons are all almost fully upgraded
1.96734E+17,Halo MP is my boomer multiplayer fix rn
1.4321E+17,And demons besides the 2 players spawn
1.96734E+17,"Halo 1 MP is a fucking meme, it's as great as I remember"
1.4321E+17,So the slayer can just chainsaw imps and stuff then yeet the 2 players
1.4321E+17,Mobile turret chaingun is still a fucking shredder

1.4321E+17,I might stream a playthrough of DMC5 soon tbh
1.96734E+17,I actually died during the very last part where he just swings his arms
1.96734E+17,lma0
1.4321E+17,Its already been a year since it came out
1.96734E+17,*it's been a year since we last met*
1.4321E+17,Yeah I didn't know what to do against that
1.96734E+17,*where does the time go?*
1.96734E+17,yeah all of the sanctus fights are fucking trash
1.96734E+17,the ending was so corny
1.96734E+17,I love it
5.00413E+17,Anyone have tabletop simulator? We could try to have a virtual game/poker night some time
5.00413E+17,Also I think tabletop sim is cheap these days ($10 ish?)
3.07631E+17,say the word and I'll dump my money back into steam
1.4321E+17,Damn people are already working on porting HL2 to the Source 2 engine thanks to HL Alyx
1.96734E+17,that's cool
1.96734E+17,HL2 feels kinda jank sometimes lol
1.4321E+17,And apparently there are already mods to play HL Alyx as a non VR game
1.4321E+17,Except you just have the HL2 weapons
1.96734E+17,but it is almost 16 lol
1.96734E+17,"oh man, that sounds like a mess"
1.96734E+17,since it's probably not balanced around that at all
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,HL Alyx almost makes me wanna try VR tho
1.96734E+17,same
1.96734E+17,but also $$$
1.96734E+17,and a dedodated VR room
1.4321E+17,If you are willing to give money to the zucc you can get the occulus 2
1.4321E+17,Has sensors built into the headset
1.96734E+17,oh bou
1.4321E+17,Only thing I'm hoping for is that the next HL that was confirmed by the ending isn't VR as well
1.96734E+17,it'll probably take another 13 years lool
1.96734E+17,so who knows
1.4321E+17,Gaben sensory gamer pods for HL3
1.96734E+17,have you played through episode 1/episode 2?
1.4321E+17,I still haven't finished HL2 :ay:
1.96734E+17,lool
1.4321E+17,I'm probably gonna start it up again soon
1.96734E+17,I prefer HL1 a good bit gameplay-wise
1.4321E+17,I got to the end of Ravenholme I think
5.00413E+17,My bet is a regular HL3 for PC and an Alyx sequel for VR
1.96734E+17,HL2 just feels like
1.96734E+17,tech-demoy?
1.96734E+17,"like ""check out this cool Source engine we made"" level design"
1.4321E+17,Yeah

1.96734E+17,two most powerful characters in the game in the same frame
1.96734E+17,HD Dunban **_N U T_**
1.4321E+17,Potemkin looks pretty fun
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,grapplers are generally very mind-gamey
1.4321E+17,Yee
1.96734E+17,/focused on conditioning your opponent to do risky shit
1.96734E+17,so you can flatten their dick
1.96734E+17,I'm too retarded to play them
1.4321E+17,I just wish he didn't have a DP anti air grab
1.4321E+17,I'm too triangle brain for DP inputs
1.96734E+17,they're a lot easier on a stick
1.96734E+17,especially w/square gate because diagonals are a lot more natural with the corners
1.4321E+17,Heavenly potemkin buster looks memey
1.96734E+17,potemkin is a walking leg day meme
1.96734E+17,but yeah he looks really fun
1.96734E+17,I'm gonna play Sol because **_GUUN FURAME_**
1.96734E+17,@Taubin https://youtu.be/1rue_Cf7Foc?t=100 aesthetic
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN CBT starts soon
1.96734E+17,Good
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN bruh Potemkin's heavy slash is l o n g
1.4321E+17,Bruh Faust can just make your hitbox bigger by giving you an afro
1.96734E+17,lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,GG mechanics are great
1.96734E+17,they just do whatever they want
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Damage is a little absurd in strive rn
1.96734E+17,yeah it seems that way
1.4321E+17,May can 100-0 you with 2 jabs into a super
1.96734E+17,good
1.96734E+17,they'll probably lower it across the board
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,older fighting games had absurd damage compared to now
1.96734E+17,like SF2 was a meme
1.4321E+17,Potemkin basically killing you in 2 busters is pretty absurd too
1.4321E+17,Granted grab range is extra short
1.96734E+17,I miss Dragon Install
1.96734E+17,Sol had a devil trigger
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,and it forced this to play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvgZzKVlYQo
1.96734E+17,whenever you activated it
1.96734E+17,which is fucking rad
1.4321E+17,It'll probably be back in the full release
1.4321E+17,No insta kills are in yet
1.96734E+17,they might not bring it back lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,or they'll retweak it
1.96734E+17,it's kind of a meme move from what I understand
1.96734E+17,super situational because it force-dizzies you when it wears off in a few seconds
1.4321E+17,I really wish the beta had a training mode
1.96734E+17,"rip, it doesn't??"
1.4321E+17,Lemme lab out shit I'll never use in a match
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,that's the only reason I play fighters lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD

1.4321E+17,Yeah it's just monkey AI that even I can beat or online whenever the servers are up
1.96734E+17,I miss Riot Stomp
1.96734E+17,it was so fucking dumb
1.4321E+17,Gun Flame feint is goofy
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,https://www.fightersgeneration.com/np2/char2/gif/sol/a/sol-riotstomp.gif
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,riot stomp was this dumb flying kick move that was super telegraphed
1.96734E+17,but I would use it full-screen to meme on my friend
1.4321E+17,Oh yes
1.96734E+17,because he always went for this sliding kick and it would cross over it
1.96734E+17,you could also roman cancel it before the actual kick started
1.96734E+17,meaning you just fly away
1.96734E+17,https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf7/char/sol-badguy-guiltygear-xrd-walk.gif
1.4321E+17,What's kinda weird so far is that almost everyone has 3 command normals with the same inputs

1.96734E+17,what inputs?
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Forward punch/kick/slash
1.96734E+17,ah
1.96734E+17,I think those have been around for a while
1.4321E+17,Ah
1.4321E+17,Wait no it might be forward heavy slash
1.96734E+17,sol had a forward punch and forward heavy slash since the first game
1.4321E+17,I still love that potemkin's heavy slash covers most of the screen
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,he is a big boy
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Also I like that you can break walls on stages
1.4321E+17,Kinda like fatal fury
1.96734E+17,oh that's cool
1.96734E+17,Sol's playstyle always kinda reminded me of Terry
1.96734E+17,"ground projectile, dashing fist move, kick flip move, shoryuken move"
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,It doesn't end a match tho it sends you both to a different part of the stage
1.96734E+17,ahh like Tekken
1.4321E+17,https://store.steampowered.com/app/960690/One_Step_From_Eden/
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN this reminds me of battle network

1.4321E+17,Same
1.96734E+17,idk how I feel about the art style in that game though
1.96734E+17,it's objectively good spritework
1.96734E+17,just not really my aesthetic
1.4321E+17,valid
1.96734E+17,I guess I miss the **_whoa dude it's the world wide web_** early 2000s cyber art style lmao

1.4321E+17,lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,battle network was basically a vaporwave RPG

5.00413E+17,"Besides normal script modules, you can create special binary modules. Such a module is loaded as a raw Buffer with binary data when you call require. It allows you to use techniques like WebAssembly to compile code written in different languages and run it in Screeps.

WebAssembly is a binary compiled code format that allows to run C/C++ or Rust code (as well as other supported languages in the future) directly with native performance. Please refer to the WebAssembly documentation for more info."

He hates Dunban and wants him dead for years, but is so laughably incompetent and impotent that Dunban doesn't even notice.

Won't even try to fight Dunban until Dunban loses the Monado and the use of an entire arm, while he himself gets cybernetic enhancements and a giant mech suit.

Cheats in basically every way you can cheat to try and win a fight. 

Still gets fucking chumped by Dunban almost every single time they fight.

Had to be saved by Shulk to prevent Dunban from killing him outright, and then goes and kills himself by accident because he's just so goddamn stupid.

Rest in fucking pieces, Mumkhar, you pathetic nobody, you suck on every perceivable level and will go down in history as a complete loser who could do basically nothing right."

1.96734E+17,Snes9x time :vergin:
1.4321E+17,like giving an option to go back to og sprites instead of the smoothed versions
1.96734E+17,ah good
1.96734E+17,bilinear filtering is a sin
1.4321E+17,yeah give me the og crusty sprites in any rerelease
1.96734E+17,agreed
1.4321E+17,it's part of the charm and sprite smoothing just doesn't look good imo
1.96734E+17,yee
1.96734E+17,some of the more sophisticated sprite upscaling algorithms look kinda good
1.96734E+17,https://i.imgur.com/aLvHq5k.png

1.4321E+17,By punching projectiles
1.4321E+17,If it isn't hitscan you can pretty much parry it
1.4321E+17,I found that out on the totally not Vergil boss
1.96734E+17,amazing
1.4321E+17,It's really good tho
1.4321E+17,Not a fan of the secret levels tho

1.96734E+17,that's how I feel about FEAR 1

1.96734E+17,that's the one with the coin tossing right
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Shotgun can charge a grenade or you can pump extra shells into it until it blows up in your face
1.4321E+17,Nailgun can shoot magnets that stick to the terrain or enemies and nails just orbit that magnet until it pops or you can super overheat the nailgun to spew nails really fast

1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN yoo the doom eternal dlc is pretty epic
1.96734E+17,it got DLC?
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,It's part 1 and ends on a cliff hanger
1.96734E+17,oh cool
1.4321E+17,But it's great
1.96734E+17,I want BLOOD to get the DooM reboot treatment
1.4321E+17,You're trying to summon the ruler of hell himself
1.4321E+17,And it isn't Satan
1.4321E+17,Only thing I really hate is the new enemy type they added
1.96734E+17,what new enemy
1.4321E+17,Spirits
1.96734E+17,RIP
1.96734E+17,sounds kinda lost-souls ish
1.96734E+17,the lost souls in the OG DOOM beta were fucking hitscanners btw
1.96734E+17,lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.4321E+17,oh they're way worse than lost spirits
1.4321E+17,they jump into an enemy and buff them up with faster movement attackspeed damage and hp
1.96734E+17,wow
1.4321E+17,then when you kill their spongey host they sit their stunned for a bit and you have to use a mod for the plasma rifle to literally ghostbusters them with a tether
1.4321E+17,and using that mod slows you down
1.4321E+17,so i really don't like them
1.4321E+17,but hey confirmed multiple doom guys now
1.96734E+17,parallel universes?
1.4321E+17,think so
1.4321E+17,UAC intern is also the biggest chad
1.96734E+17,oh
1.4321E+17,"All the UAC dudes run away from doom guy, and the intern's like 'fuck it lets summon the lord of hell doom guy I know you wanna murder him"""
1.96734E+17,amazing
1.96734E+17,the writing has become so self-aware

1.96734E+17,you have actual EXP that you need to spend on abilities instead of money
1.96734E+17,you get a lot less money from fights
1.96734E+17,"and the heat gauge is a lot harder to fill, to start at least"
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud

5.00413E+17,fuck you monopoly is already interesting
5.00413E+17,especially when you get one property of each color and hold the game hostage til someone gives you a bunch of monopolies :lma0:

6.8961E+17,Tried Borderlands 2 on PC. first time I played an FPS with keyboard and mouse. Aim is more sensitive than your dick when you're 13
6.8961E+17,but 4k at 60 fps. Shit's got juice
6.8961E+17,I sucked at the controls. I'm ashamed of myself. Can't call myself a gaymer yet
8.99591E+16,you'll get used to it
8.99591E+16,"it's a hard adjustment when you're new to it, but it becomes natural pretty quick if you can use a mouse normally"
1.96734E+17,also lower sens helps
1.96734E+17,for me at least
1.96734E+17,i am a fake gamer tho
6.8961E+17,"Guess I'll just have to play more Bordlands 2. Only solution. Hard life, I know. Also need to figure out how to turn on all the buttons on my mouse"
1.96734E+17,so take my advice accordingly
6.8961E+17,I have to play on 100 sensitivity to be MLG pro
6.8961E+17,It was on 60. I used to play with a controller
1.4321E+17,Run a trackball mouse with low dpi
6.8961E+17,"Unless trackball tech has improved a lot from what I remember in the 2000s, I don't want that shit again"
6.8961E+17,I also used to have to clean people's balls on the jet when I was active duty. No homo
6.8961E+17,"Fucking animals who eat greasy foods, then use their track ball. Fuck them"
1.96734E+17,LMFAO
1.96734E+17,you had to clean gamer gear at like 30000 feet?

8.99591E+16,Make sure your windows sensitivity is set to... 6? I think it is
6.8961E+17,"The Northrup Grumman developers actually hid a game in the jet's code. I never knew how to access it, but the super l33t people did."
8.99591E+16,And then never touch windows sensitivity again and just adjust in game and through dpi on your mouse
6.8961E+17,"First time I've ever touched sensitivity settings, so I'll have to play around"
8.99591E+16,sometimes its just the game too
8.99591E+16,For some reason however Squad handles aiming means I am incompetent when I try to aim
8.99591E+16,No matter what my settings are
1.96734E+17,that's how I feel in every game
8.99591E+16,I know I can aim because I can play plenty of games like MW and land some wild shots ez but Squad? nah I have cerebral palsy now
1.96734E+17,the bad settings are the ones in my brain
1.96734E+17,I had semi-gamer aim when I was playing Reach on PC consistently
1.96734E+17,but that atrophied months ago
1.96734E+17,also H2 legendary gives you chad aim

6.8961E+17,Look at Juri in SF4. She actually has MASSIVE feet. Her poofy pants in her default outfit are a visual trick to draw attention away from the fact that she's Bigfoot
1.96734E+17,"oh, right"
1.96734E+17,yeah SFIV proportions were wack in general
6.8961E+17,"Juri is still Bigfoot in SF5, but they took away her poofy pants, so now she looks weird"
1.96734E+17,everyone looks weird in SF5
6.8961E+17,"Well I simp for Juri, so I only notice her"

6.8961E+17,I guess Karin too. She got big hands
1.96734E+17,her default outfit is so dumb tho
6.8961E+17,I preferred the SF4 one

1.96734E+17,I only simp for TSA worker Guile
6.8961E+17,The new characters they've added have been kinda lame. I'm disappointed. Only Menat really felt like a Street Fighter character
6.8961E+17,How'd we go from people like Oro and Twelve to Kolin?
1.96734E+17,people initially thought that SF3 had too weird of a roster I think
1.96734E+17,which is a shame
6.8961E+17,"It was weird, but KoF was supposed to have the ""normal"" characters, not SF"
1.96734E+17,KOF has kpop characters
1.4321E+17,bro they clearly don't give characters massive hands or feet to make it easier to see attacks

1.4321E+17,Yeah Shun'ei's design is terrible and I love it :ay:
1.4321E+17,They wanted a protagonist that looked 'younger' for kof xiv so they hired a new younger artist
1.4321E+17,So now he's peak stupid anime design
6.8961E+17,They hired the edgiest teen in all of Tokyo

5.00413E+17,"Any minecraft people in the house I have a little poll ( @wonpons @bjarnestroustrup @JOBBIN and obviously anyone else interested)
I'm looking at trying to run a server on my laptop with massive modpack. I found 4 that I'm interested in, react accordingly to the ones you would want to play on
1Ô∏è‚É£ : All The Mods 6 - Base MC version 1.16.5 (the most recent), this is basically every fucking mod you can find. It's got machines, magic, exploration, you name it. Probably. It's brand new, I haven't really played since All the Mods 3.
2Ô∏è‚É£ : Valhesia 3 - Base MC version 1.16.5, this looks similar to ATM6. Probably a pared down mod list making it more manageable and less prone to bugs. Do some research if you actually care, because I don't.
3Ô∏è‚É£ : RLCraft - base MC version 1.12.2, this one is old, so it doesn't have new stuff like bees and nether update, but it's a super hardcore challenging pack. For REAL GAMERS ONLY
4Ô∏è‚É£ : Skyfactory 4 - Base MC version 1.12.2, This one is also old, but there's no up-to-date skyfactory that I could find üò≠ It's basically skyblock (you start in an empty world with a single block of dirt and a tree, and have to expand your platform and create shit from nothing) but with all your standard automation/tech mods."
3.07631E+17,UwU
5.00413E+17,"Damn Connor going for the old school packs, aight I see you"
3.07631E+17,"ive messed with RLCraft, kinda funny"
5.00413E+17,"Yeah we've talked about it before, that's why I included it in the list"
1.96734E+17,Skyblock would be a terrific shitfest
3.06972E+17,minekwaft
5.00413E+17,"Alright GAMERS. @JOBBIN has spoken, so I'm gonna set up a Sky Factory 4 server. It's just gonna run on my laptop so I'll only have it on when we're playing. Y'all want to start our adventure Tuesday at 7:30 for GAMER night? 

You will need to:
install Sky Factory 4. The easiest way to do this is to install the curseforge app and search for the modpack and hit install. (https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) That's how I did it, but it installed a bunch of gay overwolf bloatware that I hate, so if you want to go to the effort, google it and install it manually.

Anyone's welcome but it's definitely gonna be a shitfest and idk how stronk my laptop will be"

3.22531E+17,Coding is big gay
1.96734E+17,I'd be fine with that tbh
1.96734E+17,call-P work looks terrifying
3.22531E+17,Well im the only prov guy now...
1.96734E+17,oh rip
3.22531E+17,everyone is call p
1.96734E+17,you're like Eric on my team
1.96734E+17,"well regardless, Joe is pretty cool"
3.06972E+17,A new eric has entered the fray
1.96734E+17,yes
3.22531E+17,ergonomic eric
3.22531E+17,Yeah i got super lucky with Joe D

6.00007E+17,Ôº™  ÔºØ  Ôº•    Ôº§
3.06972E+17,@JOBBIN have you ever actually modded your FNV game?
1.96734E+17,no
3.06972E+17,b o i
3.06972E+17,its a lot of fun
1.96734E+17,the only modding I've actually done myself is for OG DooM
3.22531E+17,I just want to be Scott Ortons Call P padawan
1.96734E+17,yeah I'll start modding the fuck out of NV once I beat vanilla
1.96734E+17,same
1.96734E+17,Scott is a turbochad
3.06972E+17,even simple stuff like adding select fire makes the game a totally different experience
1.96734E+17,he knows everything about everything
3.22531E+17,He does more work than 4 people
1.96734E+17,blessed
1.96734E+17,yeah Scott is insanely talented
1.96734E+17,"idk how he does it, I feel like a retard when I touch anything"
3.06972E+17,then you get to where I am on the spectrum where you're using the GECK to make the RoF on an MG42 mod actually 1200rpm because I DOWNLOADED HITLER'S BUZZSAW **SO THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY BUZZSAW**
1.96734E+17,epic
1.96734E+17,reminds me of the dumbshit A3 mods I used to play w friends
1.96734E+17,like the fucking atrocious star wars mod
1.96734E+17,or the mecha mods
3.06972E+17,WAP
3.06972E+17,WANDER PANZER
1.96734E+17,or Op Trebuchet
3.06972E+17,Treb is dank
1.96734E+17,which was fucking awesome and hilarious
3.06972E+17,shut your whore mouth
3.22531E+17,Hes spent so much time on the system it makes sense
1.96734E+17,"I mean it is kind of funny, at least the Elites being people in skinsuits is kind of funny"
3.22531E+17,I feel pretty confident with prov now
1.96734E+17,nice
3.22531E+17,But it took me 3 features
1.96734E+17,I feel a little confident in a lot of different areas lmao
3.22531E+17,Yeah you need a feature
1.96734E+17,because I haven't done any proper dedicated work on anything other than the ITF
3.22531E+17,Rona kind of fucked you i think
1.96734E+17,agreed
3.06972E+17,"some of the most fun I've ever had in Autism 3 was running COIN ops against Insurrectionist cells on Altis as an ODST striketeam, but that was before they had to fully rebuild the HUD overlay. Doing drop pod insertions at the beginning of the mission and then having CAS via Longsword and Hornets with Pelicans for transport and sustainment was the kitties titties"
3.22531E+17,I want to get more Call P experience and try to get a job at Telegram
3.22531E+17,That would be the DREAM
1.96734E+17,rad
3.06972E+17,DUROV PLS
1.96734E+17,I did ODST shit w my friends
1.96734E+17,but not that technical :lma0:
3.06972E+17,do you play with ACE 3?
1.96734E+17,yes
3.06972E+17,based
1.96734E+17,do it
3.22531E+17,yeah getting a job at telegram is harder than google/facebook
3.22531E+17,very hard
1.96734E+17,fuck
1.96734E+17,I want to stick around Cisco long enough to work on something actually meaningful
3.22531E+17,they have programming challenges that can get you a prize + interview
1.96734E+17,o shit
3.22531E+17,Yeah you need to do that
3.22531E+17,https://contest.com/docs/ios2021-r1
3.22531E+17,I want the pay bump in the next 6 months
1.96734E+17,oh no
1.96734E+17,**_frontend_**
3.06972E+17,"I spent the other day building range tables for Nightforce ATACR LPVO on DMRs and sniper rifles using the RHS Mk5 scope because those are the only reticles that are actually graduated with mil subtensions

Arma 3 is my vidya autistic release"
3.22531E+17,They have Call P and backend ones
1.96734E+17,amazing
1.96734E+17,I just redneck holdover and keep bumping up the elevation turret
3.06972E+17,"I KNOW JAVASCRIPT AND USE MONGO DB 

**I'M A SOFTWARE DEVELOPERRRRRRRRRR**"
1.96734E+17,*haha elevation turret go click*
3.22531E+17,REEEEE JAVA SCRIPT
3.22531E+17,GET OUT
3.06972E+17,normally I don't dial for elevation unless its past like 700 and I have someone spotting and using the Kestrel/ATrag
3.06972E+17,"I just try to use reticles that I can just hold with, like IRL"
1.96734E+17,I hardly ever used range tables/adjustable scopes in A3 anyways
1.96734E+17,everyone succed off the marksman slots in my group like instantaneously
3.06972E+17,"The trick is just slapping a decent optic on even a regular carbine like an M4 SOPMOD Block II or something, then boom if you know your holds you're effective out to 500m, assuming you don't have a shitty environment like shooting across a valley by the coast reeeee"
1.96734E+17,yeee
1.96734E+17,basically what I did lma0
3.06972E+17,do you have the RHS packs installed?
1.96734E+17,I did
1.96734E+17,I haven't played A3 in months RIP
3.06972E+17,b r o
1.96734E+17,ikr
3.06972E+17,they released the ATACR F1 with the proper reticle and it actually reflects IRL in game
1.96734E+17,ah yes
1.96734E+17,EXCEL SPREADSHEET RETICLE
3.06972E+17,god king of LPVO reticles
1.96734E+17,i'm too retarded to make use of it tho
3.06972E+17,wait until you see my fav long range reticle they worked in
3.06972E+17,the TREMOR 3
1.96734E+17,what the fuc
1.96734E+17,k
3.06972E+17,its really not that complex when you get down to brass tacs
3.06972E+17,I'm lying btw
1.96734E+17,:lma0:
3.22531E+17,i have mixed feelings about this emoji
1.96734E+17,why
1.96734E+17,it's a classic
3.06972E+17,"basically
graduated stadia are .2 mil, solid stadia are 1 mil
stadia above crosshair are used for rapid ranging man sized targets or targets of a known size
horizontal numbers are for compensating for moving targets up to 10mph to 500m 
dots are for wind or moving targets at range where you have to also compensate for coriolis"
3.06972E+17,I love the autism that can be had if you crank the ACE settings up high enough
1.96734E+17,yeah no kidding
1.96734E+17,I'm used to meme vanilla ballistics
3.06972E+17,you can actually learn how to shoot PRS in Arma
3.06972E+17,which is fucking hilarious to me
3.06972E+17,Bohemia probably never thought how hard people would push their engine when they first dropped A3
1.96734E+17,lmao
1.96734E+17,I mean it's basically a ballistics sim at this point
1.96734E+17,at least the underlying tech is
3.06972E+17,"personally I think it improves the experience, the more the game reflects real life the more versatility in tactics and decisions it offers the player"
3.06972E+17,assuming the game doesn't crash or launch your MRAP into the sun because you hit a boulder
1.96734E+17,agreed
1.96734E+17,you could do some dumb shit in vanilla with regards to weapons tho
1.96734E+17,I used to run the Negev with some of the base-game LPVOs/marksman optics and fire bursts out to like 800m
1.96734E+17,or shoot on semi
1.96734E+17,they actually upped the base dispersion of the negev because I guess a lot of people were using it as a meme DMR
3.06972E+17,"""what do you shoot PRS matches with?""

hehe opem bolmt"
1.96734E+17,yes
3.06972E+17,belmt femd
1.96734E+17,*haha bolt go kerchunk*
3.06972E+17,that and the original alpha and beta versions of the intervention were hilariously overpowered
1.96734E+17,oh god
1.96734E+17,the fucking m320
3.06972E+17,.408 CheyTac does not abide by the concept of _wind_
1.96734E+17,I played a lot of KOTH
1.96734E+17,I used to wait along the flight paths of other teams and shoot down little birds with the Lynx lmao
1.96734E+17,or shoot through the tower hatches that people would camp behind
3.06972E+17,12.7x108 versus cockpit glass was my all time favorite
1.96734E+17,yes
3.06972E+17,especially the huge canopies on the Ka-60s
1.96734E+17,you could hear the smash/instrument beeping since they always flew so LOW
3.06972E+17,LEL
3.06972E+17,CRITICAL DAMAGE
1.96734E+17,the prowlers/qilins from the apex DLC were nuts for heli hunting too
1.96734E+17,basically technicals on steroids
1.96734E+17,especially the prowler bc the commander had a pintle-mounted .338 MG
1.96734E+17,so you'd park them facing towards the flight path and then have a person in both MGs
1.96734E+17,then a third person on the ground with an LMG
1.96734E+17,and swat little birds
3.22531E+17,makes me uncomfortable lol
1.96734E+17,:lma0: good
3.06972E+17,"back before RHS dropped and I was still using Massi's stuff, the play was the M107 loaded with Raufoss"
3.06972E+17,"smashing heli fuel tanks, cockpits or alt torque rotors"
3.06972E+17,that and his LAW rocket model didn't have any ballistic drop to speak of inside like 600m so that was also in play lmao
1.96734E+17,oh god
1.96734E+17,the vanilla RPG (from Apex DLC) has no drop for some reason
3.06972E+17,"""Technical, 400 meters, due south!""

'Seems they fought the LAW üòé """
3.06972E+17,even with ACE?
1.96734E+17,not sure with ACE
1.96734E+17,not sure with ACE
1.96734E+17,we never bothered bc we always used the RHS RPGs
1.96734E+17,we never bothered bc we always used the RHS RPGs
1.96734E+17,the vanilla RPG warheads also fucking airburst lmao
3.06972E+17,some of the RHS extra munitions are actually pretty helpful
1.96734E+17,after a set distance
3.06972E+17,oh yeah thats how they work IRL
1.96734E+17,"oh, nice"
3.06972E+17,its a time delay fuze that detonates after they travel a certain distance/time
3.06972E+17,Its really hard to estimate range for airburst though
3.06972E+17,"the RHS RPG can be useful if you know how to use it, but the M72A7 is by far my favorite utility rocket"
1.96734E+17,yeah the LAWs are nice
3.07631E+17,bro guns are COOL
3.07631E+17,I love shooting and stuff
3.07631E+17,Like
3.06972E+17,mainly because I can cram like 4 or 6 of them into a vehicle on top of a full sustainment load for the entire op and just keep chuckin rockets
3.07631E+17,you pioint it and SHOO T IT
3.07631E+17,"This one time, I took my gun, I put a sight on it, and shot it"
1.96734E+17,did you ever play Antistasi?
3.07631E+17,And like the bullet flew and hit the target
3.06972E+17,@wonpons
3.07631E+17,and then my dad beat me when I got home
3.06972E+17,nah I never knew what it was
1.96734E+17,"oh, it's basically a capture-the-island scenario where you start out with like nothing"
1.96734E+17,it's verrrry jank but it has reputation systems with US/OPFOR
1.96734E+17,early game is super hard bc you need to capture towns with like no vehicles or anything
1.96734E+17,so we would just get backpacks and trucks and load them with like 30 PG-7vs
1.96734E+17,then park on a hill and form an RPG line
3.06972E+17,lmfao
3.06972E+17,TALLY HO LADS
1.96734E+17,it worked out *okay*
3.06972E+17,VOLLEY FIRE YOUR ROCKETS TOWARDS THE TOWN
1.96734E+17,it's basically meme guerilla simulator
1.96734E+17,but everything is so badly implemented
3.06972E+17,that kinda sounds like Dynamic Universal Warfare System but with much less framework
1.96734E+17,"yes, basically that"
1.96734E+17,or the vanilla warlords mode
1.96734E+17,but you start out with nothing and have to loot/hoard shit
3.06972E+17,"that actually sounds pretty neat

DUWS was neat, but it was a fucking commitment"
3.06972E+17,"like, multiple day commitment"
1.96734E+17,lmao
1.96734E+17,"yeah same with antistasi, it was a full-on campaign"
1.96734E+17,you could save/quit tho
3.06972E+17,I finally FINALLY got assets to play nice with saving
1.96734E+17,oh no
3.06972E+17,but I need to tweak settings so that scripts save into the server
3.06972E+17,otherwise ACE med just completely fucks off from the Zeus console
3.06972E+17,/ree
1.96734E+17,rip
1.96734E+17,I hate tinkering with A3
3.06972E+17,its a fucking asspain
3.06972E+17,I'm not a coder STOP MAKING ME WRITE SCRIPTS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1.96734E+17,A3 scripting is cursed
3.06972E+17,"have you tried Unsung yet? I was playing on Dynamic Recon Ops in Unsung as a MACVSOG team in '68 doing HVT protection in Quang Tri province, fuck the jungle dear god"
3.06972E+17,"**_THE TREES SPEAK VIETNAMESE, THEN THEY SPEAK TRACERS_**"
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,it was jank but fun
3.06972E+17,pretty sure the VC have thermal vision like the predator
1.96734E+17,A3 AI borderline cheats in dense foliage
1.96734E+17,it makes tanoa really frustrating
3.06972E+17,"**_FUCKIGN THIS_**


when you play Unsung you basically just play JTAC the whole time and call CAS on literally everything"
1.96734E+17,yes
3.06972E+17,cluster bombs and napalm the whole jungle
1.96734E+17,i basically gave up on tanoa entirely
1.96734E+17,bc my PC also gets crusty in the foliage
1.96734E+17,depending on the tree aliasing settings lmao
3.06972E+17,"mine kinda does, I'm due for a GPU upgrade"
3.06972E+17,my 970 is finally slowing down
1.96734E+17,same
3.06972E+17,"RTX 3080 time, who needs TWO kidneys :lma0:"
1.96734E+17,oh no
3.06972E+17,I wish it wasn't so jank
3.06972E+17,Viet vibes are soooooooooo just
3.06972E+17,!wide aesthetic
6.00007E+17,ÔΩÅÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩâÔΩÉ
1.96734E+17,all of A3 is jank lole
3.06972E+17,>me to the server anytime I try to LAN with my dad
3.06972E+17,!deepfry
1.96734E+17,yes
1.81573E+17,If you buy a new GPU definitely use it to mine crypto if your electricity costs are ~0.10. I got my 3070 to do 59 MH/s at 160 W with an under volt and a vram OC. I stoped doing it because I was worried about it opening up my network to an attack and I do stuff worth more than $150 a month on my network lol. But if you‚Äôre feeling confident then you can pay off a 3080 like that.
3.06972E+17,my boy
3.06972E+17,my lad
3.06972E+17,what an absolute fucking _**CHAD**_
1.81573E+17,:Ricardo:
3.06972E+17,"""Bitch, get over here and have sex with @meda. I'm Rick James bitch"""
1.81573E+17,The GPUs are expensive right now because they‚Äôve got real value
3.06972E+17,I think I'm at like maybe $0.05-$0.08 kWh
1.81573E+17,So yeah you could probably mine really efficiently with a 3080

5.00413E+17,I find myself thinking more about trees than work today
3.06972E+17,heheh
3.06972E+17,:weed: trees br0
5.00413E+17,nah I'm not a fuckin degenerate burnout
5.00413E+17,I'm talking about minecraft
5.00413E+17,real gamer bois will understand
3.07631E+17,Brian here's some instructions
3.07631E+17,"0. Install Forge: `java -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2854-installer.jar`

1. This mod pack runs off Minecraft 1.12.2 which is dependent on Java 8: `apt install openjdk-8-jre`

   Run a `java --version` and it'll probly won't say anything about java 8; All is good

2. Open the Minecraft launcher and click on *Installations* on the top ribbon menu; Create a new Installation or edit the *forge* installation profile that was created by the forge installer.

3. Name it *Sky Fuckery* or somethin, but make sure it's using the forge version we just installed.

4. Create a new folder literally anywhere and name it *Sky Fuckin You* or something and set that directory's path as the *Game Directory* in this new installation.

   Leave this new folder empty for now"
3.07631E+17,"5. Point the *Java Executable* to your fresh install of java 8

   It should be `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java`,
   but run `update-alternatives --list java` to know where the hell it is

6. Optional: give Minecraft 4 gigs of ram if you can in the *JVM Arguments* field

   Change `-Xmx2G` to `-Xmx4G`

7. Save your installation and run it; Forge will create some files in it's fresh game directory we supplied

8. Quit Minecraft and Copy paste all of the folders from the Sky Factory Server zip file into your Sky Factory's game directory. You'll be replacing a few things, all good just do it

LOCATION: We are on a foreign planet in the area labeled Grass Fields, located at grid X2Y0. Our primary objective is located at the area labeled Islands located at grid X0Y1. Weather conditions and visibility are expected to be fair but subject to change. Please hold all questions to the end.
SITUATION: User My Balls Ur Chin has established a new raw materials factory at grid location X0Y1 marked Islands. Construction of the baseline manufacturing systems is nearly complete, save for a steel foundry that is missing an efficient coal line moving 475 units of coal per minute to meet the required output. 
UNIT: Two or more BLUFOR engineers will carry out this operation. OPFOR are indigenous lifeforms of varying size and species.
ACTIVITY: Enemy forces were last seen mulling around items and areas, routinely patrolling established paths and pulling sentry duty
EQUIPMENT: OPFOR was not seen using inorganic equipment

COMMANDERS INTENT: Construction of the steel components factory at grid X0Y1 with minimal casualties to maximize efficiency in the Area of Operations."

1.96734E+17,üò≠
1.4321E+17,There were so many scenes near the end I couldn't take seriously
1.4321E+17,Memes ruined the drama of the desk slam scene
1.96734E+17,Good
1.4321E+17,The final fights were pretty good tho
1.4321E+17,Ryuji was an ultra chad
1.96734E+17,Yeah that's what I heard
1.96734E+17,Best villain in the series
1.4321E+17,I see why people say he's the best
1.96734E+17,Because he steals pants
1.4321E+17,Also wasn't a big fan of majima's story
1.4321E+17,Meeting makoto again was really sad but the plot of the storyline overall felt kinda pointless
1.96734E+17,But what about haha funny construction hat man
1.4321E+17,Majima does hit his goons with the best advice at the end when they start majima construction
1.4321E+17,He just tells them to look up how to build things on the internet

5.00413E+17,"ultimately we can start whenever we have like 5-6 people. Right now it's me, connor, you, and hopefully Brian"
3.07631E+17,Yo why version 1.2 tho btw?
5.00413E+17,"it was the newest release when my work group used it, and that's what brian tried to install too. If we really want to, we can do the latest, but then I'd have to switch back and forth every time I played with work vs with y'all"
5.00413E+17,But if y'all want to use latest I can update mine

3.07631E+17,@bjarnestroustrup here's a better version https://github.com/NotHunter101/ExtraRolesAmongUs/issues/19#issuecomment-782232455
3.07631E+17,"also we should probly be using at least version 1.2.6, there's some spicy patches from 1.2.4 to 1.2.6"
3.07631E+17,"```
Fixed a game-breaking bug that would occur if a vote was skipped inside a game containing the Joker.
---
Added more visibility settings for the shielded player. (Courtesy of BrandonLOrellana)
Fixed a bug that allowed dead Engineers to call sabotages.
Changed the Engineer's color to a lighter orange so it's more distinguishable from the Impostor red.
Change it so when players are exiled, their roles are revealed. (assuming Confirm Ejects are on)
Switch the Joker win-screen to only appear when the Exile Cutscene is over.

3.07631E+17,risky today? mr spoiler has arived
3.07631E+17,LOCK BOX BUFF
3.07631E+17,"```
Rusted Key
üåß Now subtly glows and pulses
Now grants items at the same rarity as a Large Chest
Now spawns a Lockbox per player with a Rusted Key
Now consumes a Rusted Key when a lockbox is opened, and requires a Rusted Key to open
No longer scales reward chance with the number of Keys in your inventory
Developer Notes: People have always been a bit confused about the behavior of the Rusted Key, so we made it make a bit more sense by actually consuming a key to open. 1 Key = 1 Box. Since the item no longer gives ‚Äòinfinite‚Äô items, we can also make it a bit stronger and make the lockbox more noticeable.
```"
5.00413E+17,Yooo
3.07631E+17,POLLUP BUFF
1.4321E+17,There's actually 2 new survivors in the update btw
3.07631E+17,"```
Minions
Drones no longer have resistance to AOE attacks
üåß All minions now teleport to their owner if they stray past 400m
üåß All Minions now scale to the ‚Äòambient level‚Äô of the run
Developer‚Äôs Notes: The ‚Äòambient level‚Äô is the level of the run that grows over time. Previously, the enemy team used the ‚Äòambient level‚Äô to set their level. Now, all enemies AND minions are at ambient level. The result of this is that player minions, like ghosts from Happiest Mask, purchased Drones, and yes - the Squid Polyp - will scale much better over time. This matches drone scaling in RoR1.

Energy Drink
üåß Speed Boost: 30% (+20% per stack) ‚áí 25% (+25% per stack)
Developer Notes: Mathematically, the Energy Drink was worse than the Goat Hoof for speed after the first pickup, even while sprinting. This change will consistently make Energy Drink stronger when sprinting, and also makes its stacking behavior more consistent. This may make the Energy Drink too strong, but it‚Äôll at least make a bit more sense now.

1.64534E+17,first playthrough used melee weapons
3.06972E+17,Some lost damage rebalancing mod I can't find anymore changed armors to their real life NIJ certified equivalents
1.96734E+17,I think @Taubin made all of the khans or vipers or something commit die w/ ballistic fist on his first playthrough
3.06972E+17,So basically any helmet short of power armor was max Level IIIA

5.00413E+17,Very cool point
5.00413E+17,Send the video because I'm retarded
3.06972E+17,pretty much we could have just slapped a locomotive going the other direction and just had it go back and forth between two points

5.00413E+17,"Yeah that makes it harder to have other stops I think? I think I asked what you would prefer when we set it up, there are definitely some kind of tradeoffs"
3.06972E+17,"also, now I want to build a locomotive hub since the overall mathematical investment cost to build a long railway costs less than trying to build massive pipelines and conveyor busses"
3.06972E+17,Yeah basically it can only go point A to B in that set up
3.06972E+17,but its already a closed loop so
5.00413E+17,Yeah I have had the dream of a raw materials locomotive hub to carry every type of material into one massive storage spot
5.00413E+17,It is a huge time investment and always goes belly up before I finish

3.06972E+17,I'm trying to determine if the load balance is even required if you just HAHA BELMT with Mk 4 conveyors
5.00413E+17,I think the load balancer becomes unnecessary if you switch to a single input with mk 4 conveyors instead of 2 inputs
5.00413E+17,"If you want to match form you could just split a single mk4 input into the two input slots and that one splitter ""load balances"" you lol"

3.06972E+17,it moves some ungodly number of coal

3.06972E+17,the freight station picks up 960 units per minute
3.06972E+17,which will go to 1200 per minute when I get Mk5s
5.00413E+17,yeah just not sure if the train keeps up. We can always boost that by adding more locomotives though
3.06972E+17,it takes about 1 min and 45 seconds for the train to go from source to station 1
3.06972E+17,then 1 min 45 back iirc
5.00413E+17,that's pretty quick

5.00413E+17,depends if you already have way too much power generation
3.06972E+17,I have to go look at what all oil can produce
5.00413E+17,"it's basically just fuel, plastic, and rubber. There are some byproducts that can be used elsewhere too, like polymer resin and petroleum coke"
3.06972E+17,I think Jametrain moves like 4800m^3 of oil like every 4 minutes or something absurd
5.00413E+17,polymer resin is nice because it lets you automate fabric
5.00413E+17,oh that's a lot of oil
3.06972E+17,üá∫üá∏
1.96734E+17,cumtrain
3.06972E+17,I actually think its 3600m^3
3.06972E+17,because its three pure nodes that are fully overclocked
5.00413E+17,mk2 pipes?
3.06972E+17,on three(?) freight platforms
3.06972E+17,yeah mk2 pimps
5.00413E+17,I think mk2 pipes are limited to 600m^3?
1.96734E+17,@Autismo Primero did I ever show you my A3 modpack I'm working on?
3.06972E+17,no you did not monke
1.96734E+17,just vanilla gear retextures
1.96734E+17,gimme a sec
5.00413E+17,but I guess 1800/minute is still more than 3600/4minute
3.06972E+17,that math is coming from what I believe is 3 freight cars and transit taking 4 minutes end to end

3.06972E+17,"3600m^3 from origin to production in 3 min 35 seconds

Storage capacity is 14,400m^3 between 3 platforms and 3 buffers downstream of those platforms"
3.06972E+17,@JohnnyTarr what is the best course of action for productivity?
5.00413E+17,"honestly I would split it 50/50 between fuel and rubber/plastic.
My setup is pretty complicated, but I think it's optimized well"
5.00413E+17,"basically you want to maximize fuel production by turning all your crude into heavy oil residue, then combining that with water to make the diluted fuel recipe"
5.00413E+17,whatever byproducts you get from that process turn into residual plastic/rubber
5.00413E+17,"then you want to take half the fuel you made, pump it to fuel generators for power (you can siphon off some here to package if you need jetpack fuel)"
5.00413E+17,"take the other half and use it all in the ""recycled rubber/plastic"" alternate recipe, with the outputs sort of feeding back in as inputs to keep doubling up your plastic/rubber"
6.00007E+17,discovered
3.06972E+17,"So I have a genny plant already, and I think I'm producing about 54.8 units of fuel/min with plenty of back storage for now. I have nearly no rubber production, but I have 160 plastic/min, but I'm gonna need to turn that up for computers and super computers I think"
3.06972E+17,"Missing units of priority to access next tier are:
**Circuit Boards**
**High-Speed Connectors**
**Computers**
**Smart Plating**
**Automated Wiring**
**Versatile Frameworks**
**Modular Engines**
**Adaptive Control Units**"
5.00413E+17,"You can easily adjust the ratios of plastic to rubber, I think you'll want much more plastic than rubber"
5.00413E+17,"And if you really think you're good on power (unless you've done something wild, you're probably not good on power) then you can divert all the fuel into rubber/plastic production"
5.00413E+17,"I think my whole circuit board/computer/high speed connector line uses no plastic, I went for the silica based play because I didn't have a good way to transport my plastic"

8.99591E+16,my friend asked me if ocelot is canon gay and so I had to explain the lore
1.96734E+17,"I mean he is, no?"
8.99591E+16,basically
1.96734E+17,It's at least heavily implied
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
1.96734E+17,Thanks bot
8.99591E+16,but you can't just say yes because it's never explicitly stated
1.96734E+17,Got me good
8.99591E+16,so I had to explain the lore
1.96734E+17,That explains most of the mgs characters
1.96734E+17,"""basically gay but never explicitly stated"""
1.96734E+17,"Besides like, vamp and volgin"
1.96734E+17,Ty kojimbo
1.96734E+17,@Taubin post that one ocelot kissing meme I can't find it
1.96734E+17,I love all the 2000s forum posts with extreme mental gymnastics about how hetero MGS is
8.99591E+16,you gotta love that ocelot is the child of two of the cobras but also was brought up in russia but was also an nsa code breaker who defects to russia but is actually a double agent who meets his adopted brother while fighting and then his mom kills his dad who comes back as a ghost and then his brother kills his mom who also comes back as a ghost but not really and then repeatedly brainwashes himself to help the snakes while simultaneously being a double agent for all of them with a final goal of throwing the entire world into chaos as part of big boss' will to the point where he creates a secret network to run america through memes and then dies from a virus designed to kill his brother's like weird girlfriend titty lady thing and also his brother so he fights his brothers clone on the roof and its extremely sexually tense and then he dies

1.96734E+17,Thanks me too
8.99591E+16,yeah
1.96734E+17,And cutscenes
8.99591E+16,I feel like I have schizophrenia when I try to explain MGS lore
8.99591E+16,also I was reminded of Hot Coldman today
1.96734E+17,MGS is inherently schizo
8.99591E+16,Death Stranding is very good but man it's no MGS schizo lore over the course of like 25 years
1.96734E+17,The MSX games are so retroactively fucked by every subsequent game
1.96734E+17,It's kind of great
8.99591E+16,I really love that Dunkey's MGS lore explanation video is completely accurate and like one of the most concise explanations of it out there
8.99591E+16,also yeah
8.99591E+16,it's funny
8.99591E+16,They're constantly sources to lore yet constantly completely irrelevant
1.96734E+17,I love dunkeys MGS synopsis
8.99591E+16,It's extremely accurate and yet it misses huge chunks of lore
1.96734E+17,He hardly exaggerates and yet it's still batshit
8.99591E+16,Yeah
8.99591E+16,It's like literally easiest parts of the lore to explain
1.96734E+17,Because kojimbo just like does stuff
8.99591E+16,and skips all of MGSV which is completely fucking insane in its own right
1.96734E+17,"""hey this would be sick. Make game about it"""
1.96734E+17,"I feel like MGSV exists solely to retcon big boss ""dying"" in MG1"
1.96734E+17,At least from a plot perspective
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
8.99591E+16,yeah it totally does
1.96734E+17,Which is funny as fuck
8.99591E+16,And I think I prefer it that way
8.99591E+16,"MGSV is great, I just wish that it wasn't unfinished"
1.96734E+17,Because it just turns venom into funny pixel man who speaks engrish and dies in mg1
8.99591E+16,yeah
8.99591E+16,lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD

1.96734E+17,Man I love mgsv gameplay but it falls apart so hard
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,I still don't really understand what happened in that game lmao
8.99591E+16,me neither
8.99591E+16,Like the sections i get are great and I fill in the gaps and I get it
1.96734E+17,Things just kind of happened
1.96734E+17,"And you're like ""yeah, I guess"""
8.99591E+16,But so much shit I can't explain because the thing explaining it was literally ripped out of the entire fucking game without ANY attempt to explain it
8.99591E+16,so you just take it as face value
1.96734E+17,Yes
8.99591E+16,idk why I did anything in MGSV
1.96734E+17,Like the skulls? What the fuck was that about
8.99591E+16,Yet I did it and it was compelling in the moment
1.96734E+17,It fell apart hard once you leave Afghanistan
8.99591E+16,And then I finished the game and I was like... damn... war bad
1.96734E+17,Africa map was kind of shit imo
8.99591E+16,I love the big open parts of Africa that clearly had stuff planned
1.96734E+17,Yeah it's just nothingness
8.99591E+16,"And then it was like, yeah we ran out of time to do this"
1.96734E+17,It has so many cool mechanics and then this piecemeal storyline jank
8.99591E+16,"Here's a very well crafted location that is set up for something bigger, but I'm never having you go back because the part of the game that would go here is missing due to it being pushed out the door"
1.96734E+17,Yes
1.96734E+17,Exactly
8.99591E+16,I'm glad Kojima can do shit on his own timeline now but damn it really is what could have been
6.00007E+17,"Hi glad Kojima can do shit on his own timeline now but damn it really is what could have been, I'm Terminus!"
1.96734E+17,üò≠
1.96734E+17,I still enjoyed it a lot
1.96734E+17,Basically no lifed it summer before junior year
8.99591E+16,yup
8.99591E+16,it has a really compelling yet simple gameplay loop for tons of it
8.99591E+16,afghanistan is literally you going to the same handful of places on a deceptively small map over and over again
1.96734E+17,Yes
8.99591E+16,and yet it found ways to make doing literally the same things repeatedly fun and interesting
1.96734E+17,But it's a map w a lot of variety
1.96734E+17,Like you can tell it wasn't rushed like Africa was
8.99591E+16,"like I can distinctly remember the locations I was *constantly* going to, be it for a story mission or side mission, but I had fun doing it anf wanted to and got really good at it"
8.99591E+16,yeah
8.99591E+16,It's well crafted is how I always saw it
1.96734E+17,Lots of terrain variety
1.96734E+17,And well designed outposts
8.99591E+16,Africa has portions that are well designed and thought out and you can see what they were doing
1.96734E+17,For memes
8.99591E+16,It just straight up is obvious it is unfinished
8.99591E+16,Tons of those huge open areas in Africa are set up in a way that made logical sense to have something there
8.99591E+16,"and looked it, they were always sparse of anything"
1.96734E+17,I just remember it being a chore to traverse
8.99591E+16,"Little grass, rocks or trees that were significantly more plentiful in the worked on parts of the map"
1.96734E+17,"The only landmarks I remember are that field hospital, the water tower part, and that big estate/mansion"
1.96734E+17,And that one factory/purification plant?
8.99591E+16,the estate is super cool
8.99591E+16,also yeah the purification plant with tons of bodies
1.96734E+17,Yeah and dudes clear it with riot shields and shit
8.99591E+16,there's the weird camp that eli was at too
1.96734E+17,I think you rescue code talker from that estate
8.99591E+16,in the basement yeah
1.96734E+17,It's been so long rip
8.99591E+16,"also I still really love that code talker literally photosynthesizes everything he needs but he's like, yeah, hamburger"
1.96734E+17,Yes
8.99591E+16,and he and miller go on an adventure to make the best burger possible
1.96734E+17,He can still eat recreationally
1.96734E+17,Deep lore
8.99591E+16,recreational eating lol
1.96734E+17,Kaz literally embezzling war crime funds to make the ultimate burger in secret
8.99591E+16,also code talker is old as dirt because the parasites that murder people went in his body and replaced his organs
8.99591E+16,like ok
1.96734E+17,Totally out of character considering he's a grumpy cripple for the rest of the game
8.99591E+16,hamburgers specifically change people
1.96734E+17,That's a very Kojima plot device
1.96734E+17,Basically nanomachines
6.00007E+17,"No, Snake - the nanomachines are functioning fine! It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis, FOXHOUND's psychic."
8.99591E+16,it's like quiet being a frog as a justification for her being basically naked
1.96734E+17,"Wow, I don't think I've ever triggered that bot regex on accident"
8.99591E+16,so he could justify having lots of scenes of her showering while diamond dogs go hrrrng horny
1.96734E+17,"No you see, quiet breathes through her booba"
8.99591E+16,you dont understand snake she HAS to be basically naked
1.96734E+17,It's important that she's naked for more reasons
1.96734E+17,Mom why the fuck are you unplugging my xboxi
6.00007E+17,discovered
8.99591E+16,I never installed the mod to give her the cipher outfit back but I actually really like the design
1.96734E+17,I just told you she's naked for lore reasons
1.96734E+17,You can give her the sniper wolf jumpsuit
1.96734E+17,Which is at least decent
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
8.99591E+16,me playing MGS3 in the living room after I forgot my save point and repeatedly replayed the scene with EVA getting dressed that gives you the option to look at her tits or look at her tits
1.96734E+17,I keep forgetting that you can just kill her outright
1.96734E+17,"Lmao, EVA"
6.00007E+17,dude XD
8.99591E+16,EVA is a character
8.99591E+16,I still haven't finished MGS3 since I never have an xbox on hand
8.99591E+16,or its in the living room and I don't have time to use it
1.96734E+17,I played mgs3 in like 2013
1.96734E+17,damn
1.96734E+17,I hate my wife
8.99591E+16,I have played it off and on for years and never finished it
1.96734E+17,The feed ramp is polished to a mirror sheen
1.96734E+17,The interlock between the frame and the slide has been tightened for added precision
8.99591E+16,For reference I have been named The Pain basically since I got to The Pain's fight
8.99591E+16,so...
8.99591E+16,at least 3 years
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
1.96734E+17,THE PAIN
8.99591E+16,I am constantly reminded I've yet to finish it which I think is why I've just come to accept it lol
1.96734E+17,"First of all, the feeding ramp is polished to a mirror sheen. It's not going to have any feeding problems. The slide's been replaced with a reinforced version, and it meshes perfectly with the frame. The frame itself has been iron-welded and scraped down multiple times for maximum precision. The front strap part of the frame has been checkered to make it dig into the hand. That prevents any slipping. The sight system's original too. It's a 3-dot type. It's got an enlarged front sight, giving it superior target sighting capability. The regular hammer's been replaced with a ring hammer. That enhances the cocking control and increases the hammer-down speed. They also reworked the grip safety to accommodate the ring hammer. It looks like they eliminated it altogether. This is a tool for pros. The thumb safety and slide stop are extended for precise handling. The base of the trigger guard is whittled down so you can use a high grip, and the trigger itself is a long type for easy finger access. The trigger pull is about 3.5 pounds. that's about a pound and a half lighter than normal. The magazine well has been widened to make it easier to put in a new magazine. The magazine catch button has been filed down low to make it harder to hit it by mistake. The mainspring housing has been changed to a flat type to increase grip, and it's even been fitted with stepping so that it won't slip from the recoil when firing. On top of that, they added cocking serrations to the top part of the slide. That lets you load and eject cartridges faster in an emergency. Whoever did this is a professional, no question. This thing could shoot a one-hole at 25 yards in a machine rest."
1.96734E+17,Mfw enhanced cock control
1.96734E+17,Mfw cock serrations
8.99591E+16,I'm gonna give my cock an RMR cut
6.00007E+17,"Hi gonna give my cock an RMR cut, I'm Terminus!"
1.96734E+17,Epic
1.96734E+17,As long as you don't put an RMR on it
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN I'm sorry what https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552550/Castlevania_Advance_Collection/

2.22167E+17,How about a DS collection?
1.96734E+17,Touch screen parts might be kind of jank depending on console probably
1.96734E+17,Dawn of Sorrow boss drawing minigame was ass
2.22167E+17,Modders patched out touch controls from Dawn of Sorrow. It's doable. I don't remember Portrait of Ruin having touch controls but it's been a long time
1.96734E+17,PoR was awesome
1.96734E+17,Basically no touch controls

1.96734E+17,"I had a boxed copy of the PC port, it was a 5 CD install"

1.96734E+17,Otherwise you'd just fall into space
1.96734E+17,And you had to basically AFK inside a spawn vehicle otherwise the AI from either team would just steal it and crash into the wall
1.4321E+17,Hell yeah
1.96734E+17,Damn the AI was lobotomized in bf2

5.00413E+17,"""bringing back Doretta is the ultimate litmus test for whether a Dwarf is capable of self-governing.

To return the Doretta is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct, appropriate thing to do. To return Doretta is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a Dwarf is not able to return Doretta.

Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your Doretta. Therefore Doretta presents itself as the apex example of whether a Dwarf will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning Doretta, no one will kick you or kill you for not returning Doretta, you gain nothing by returning Doretta. You must return Doretta out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return Doretta because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct.

A Dwarf who is unable to do this is no better than a Leaf-Lover, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with an objective and the consequences for not doing the objective.

Doretta is what determines whether a Dwarf is a good or bad member of the mining-team. ""

You'd probably be cum in a sock or swallowed by some whore a truck stop if it wasn't for your dad, who is a boomer. Boomers are awesome, they made the world what it is today. Thanks to them the planet is getting warmer so we get to spend more time at the beach, they've made the planet a better place for us and we should be grateful. Stop hating on boomers it makes you look like the spoiled brat that you are. Boomers created spongebob and Rick and Morty and all the gay cartoons you love. Maybe you should watch more boomer shows and stfu you little bitch. Guess what? Joker was played by a boomer dumbass so why so serious??? You fucking millennial zoomers need to shut the fuck up!!! Why don't you go jack off on Snapchat to some e thot or make a fool of yourself on TikTok of the world to remember you as a waste of breath??! Shut up Boomer?!!?!?!? How about you attach some breast pumps to your huge man boobs and make some breast milk cheese to sell in the local farmers market because what else are you good for you young sapling!!! Saying ok boomer isn't funny!! YOU SHUT UP! IDIOT!"

1.96734E+17,"A railgun is a linear motor device, typically designed as a weapon, that uses electromagnetic force to launch high velocity projectiles. The projectile normally does not contain explosives, instead relying on the projectile's high speed, mass, and kinetic energy to inflict damage.[2] The railgun uses a pair of parallel conductors (rails), along which a sliding armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the armature and then back along the other rail. It is based on principles similar to those of the homopolar motor.[3]

As of 2020, railguns have been researched as weapons utilizing electromagnetic forces to impart a very high kinetic energy to a projectile (e.g. APFSDS) rather than using conventional propellants. While explosive-powered military guns cannot readily achieve a muzzle velocity of more than ‚âà2 km/s, railguns can readily exceed 3 km/s. For a similar projectile, the range of railguns may exceed that of conventional guns. The destructive force of a projectile depends on its kinetic energy and mass at the point of impact and because of the potentially high velocity of a railgun-launched projectile, its destructive force may be much greater than conventionally launched projectiles of the same size. The absence of explosive propellants or warheads to store and handle, as well as the low cost of projectiles compared to conventional weaponry, come as additional advantages.[4]

Not withstanding the above advantages, railguns are still very much at the research stage after decades of R&D, and it remains to be seen whether or not they will ever be deployed as practical military weapons. Any trade-off analysis between electromagnetic (EM) propulsion systems and chemical propellants for weapons applications must also factor in its durability, availability and economics, as well as the novelty, bulkiness, high energy demand and complexity of the pulsed power supplies that are needed for electromagnetic launcher systems."

1.96734E+17,Czech people go hard
1.96734E+17,it's probably because Eastern Europe is so brutal historically
1.96734E+17,(and right now lmao)
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,that sort of political climate leads to stuff like STALKER and ARMA

6.00007E+17,Unknown command.
1.96734E+17,"First, start off with an Electric Wind God Fist. This attack has increased hitsun, allowing you to true combo into an Electric Wind God Fist. Now, because of this move's extra hitsun, you should have enough time to combo into an Electric Wind God Fist. After that, for a true combo, follow up with an Electric Wind God Fist. Next, take advantage of the high hitstun of Electric Wind God Fist, and perform an Electric Wind God Fist. Finally, finish the combo with an Electric Wind God Fist. After finishing the combo, continue the combo with an Electric Wind God Fist. And if you did everything correctly, you should be able to use that move's massive hitstun for a finisher. In this case, EWGF, that's an acronym that means Electric Wind God Fist.

1.4321E+17,Btw Testament's scythe dictates the color of the blood effects
1.4321E+17,So 09 has a cum scythe
2.22167E+17,so we just give him Bridget colors and not include Bridget?
2.22167E+17,fuck this game. I'm only playing Karnov's Revenge
1.96734E+17,Excellent choice
1.4321E+17,Bridget was like 12 years old dude
2.22167E+17,"Bridget worked at Jam's restaurant. According to Japanese law, that would be illegal at age 12.

You just got destroyed by FACTS and LOGIC"
2.22167E+17,Liberal
1.4321E+17,This is a fictional game set in a future where Japan got nuked off the face of the earth
1.4321E+17,Jam ran a chinese restaurant too I'm pretty sure
2.22167E+17,"I'm pretty sure Jam's restaurant is Japanese, hence why she speaks broken Japanese in the original audio. Or maybe Japan is just making fun of those Chinamen again, hence why the Chinese character is once again an amazon"
2.22167E+17,"Which I'm not sure if you or others noticed that, but Japan used to assume all Chinese women were barbaric amazons, hence why Chun Li looks like a stereotypical Chinese amazon woman"
2.22167E+17,"It's also a Japanese stereotype that all Koreans are evil. When Juri was introduced into SF4, that was a huge LOL moment for everyone who knew"
2.22167E+17,"FANG from SF5 is the Japanese stereotype of Chinese men. Effeminate, evil tricksters. Never change, Japan"
1.96734E+17,same w/ basically every Chinese character in Yakuza
2.22167E+17,"Old school classic. Chinese woman is a barbaric amazon. Chinese man is an effeminate, evil trickster"
2.22167E+17,both also dress similar to Chun Li and FANG
2.22167E+17,I wonder what Japan thinks Filipinos are
1.96734E+17,absolutely sub-subhuman lmao
1.96734E+17,if WW2 is anything to go by
1.4321E+17,Chip also speaks made up gibberish that sounds vaguely Japanese in most of the games
2.22167E+17,He's just a weaboo
2.22167E+17,"> A former drug trafficker and addict
> Origin: United States"
2.22167E+17,"Chipp is mostly a joke, but there's so many examples of Chinese female characters like Jam for decades that you know it's not a coincidence"
2.22167E+17,Chinese woman in Shaman King
2.22167E+17,I also love how the only black guy in Shaman King ends up in jail in the end. He was a good guy too

The navy launches ships, the air force send their jets
And nothing can withstand our fixed bayonets

The enemy has multiplied and formed a massive group
We better beat these bugs before we're all turned to soup

2.22167E+17,is gay hentai a substitute?
1.96734E+17,be a BEAST
1.96734E+17,only BEASTS reply
1.96734E+17,"I used to work as a graphic designer in sports marketing place. The CEO was a real ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" hardworking businessman. They have big problems. All these employees would spend ALL FUCKING DAY on their computers playing fantasy football and like talking about it on lunch. ""Oh man, you seen that dunk last night? THAT GUY'S A BEAST, DUDE! HE WAS RIPPIN DOWN THE LANE, HE FLEW OVER THEM, HE WAS A BEAST! A BEAST! Did you see how ripped he is? Do you know what he would do to you in a fight? DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WOULD DO TO YOU IN A FIGHT?! He's RIPPED, man. Oh, man, Kevin Garnett's a BEAST. Did you see him go to the hall? Kevin Garnett's a BEAST, dude. coughing Dude, Federer is a fucking hulk. He's a BEAST. Hulkmaniac BEAST! Can you imagine if he put his arms around you? He's a BEAST! BEAST, DUDE! Stone Cold, Diesel, BEAST! Male cheerleaders. Can you imagine if he was fucking your girlfriend? I think about that every day when I go to work. Fucking lift weights, do something yourself. If seeing muscles makes you want to suck someone's dick that bad, go lift weights and then you look in the mirror, you suck your own dick. IMAGINE IF HE WAS FUCKING YOUR GIRLFRIEND? HE WOULD BE A BEAST! SAVAGE BEAST! BEAST! Just watch gay porn... If you like sports: cut to the chase - watch gay porn. Think about BIG MALE BUTTOCKS and BIG MALE BICEPS hugging you, going around your neck as you get FUCKED IN THE ASS. Think about BIG COCKS going in your ass. If you like sports: cut to the chase - go and get fucked in the ass. Go on Craigslist, post pictures of yourself and your dick saying you're a bottom, you need a muscular top. ""I need a musc gl for dbf (discreet buttfucking). By the way, I like sports. Codeword: ""I like sports"". You know what that means. WINK WINK. Be a beast. Only beasts reply. Don't reply unless you're a beast. And then you can go get fucked in the ass and you can suck dick if you like sports. And that's it, that's the simple answer to your problem: IF YOU LIKE SPORTS SO MUCH THAT YOU USE SOCIAL NETWORKING APPS TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND YOU MAKIN' TWEETS ABOUT SPORTS ALL DAY AND YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE TEAMS ON FACEBOOK AND POSTING HIGHLIGHTS AND POSTING VIDEOS- If you post a sports video on Facebook today: go on Craigslist, find somebody to fuck you in the ass and you can suck your dick all you want, okay? And you get it out of my face. I don't wanna see this shit. Fucking FAGGOTS, man. That's another word I try to use sparingly, but if you like sports YOU'RE A FUCKING FAGGOT ((if you like sports, you're a faggot, fuck you)) ((if you love sports, you're a faggot))."

1.96734E+17,*Switch to Ubuntu with a different desktop environment. Ubuntu is gay*
1.96734E+17,Mint is based on OOBOONTOO

2.22167E+17,"Mint specializes in the Hadoken, while Ubuntu specializes in the Shoryuken. Very different"
2.22167E+17,There's technically a Mint not based on Ubuntu
1.96734E+17,they're all debian + garbage on top at the end of the day
2.22167E+17,I don't want to read the Arch Wiki after I get off work
4.94592E+17,"I use Pop which is also based on Ubuntu/Debian, but I have Manjaro on laptop and it is just as cancerous"
2.22167E+17,I had issues with a Dual Monitor setup last time I tried Manjaro and I wasn't dealing with that kind of shit on a daily driver
2.22167E+17,There's a little too much playing Geek Squad with Manjaro for my taste.

1.96734E+17,the rabbit hole deepens
1.90984E+17,All by hand and my calculator
3.06972E+17,It basically let's you IRL it using your preferred method of target location and the AI determines its firing data
3.06972E+17,"So for period correct prairie fire stuff, worm formula polar missions, plotted grid missions, and possibly shift missions I just haven't tried it yet"
1.96734E+17,nothing we've done so far is period-accurate lmao

3.06972E+17,That's it?
2.2E+17,never had huge numbers
3.06972E+17,There it is
2.2E+17,"plt net was over the 148s to other squad leaders only, 343s for intra-squad when intra-squad had radios"
1.96734E+17,ha ha you guys get radios? üò≥
2.2E+17,"we did lots of missions of ""not us forces"" so it wasnt guaranteed that everyone would have them"
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,short range was a luxury lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,those were more fun imo
2.2E+17,agreed
1.96734E+17,just being a squad of AK retards that had to yell over eachother
2.2E+17,"i really liked the russia missions where there were no man portable radios, you got a rack radio on the back of the btr and a fucking vehicle phone to talk to the crew"
3.06972E+17,"I figure CoTac, Plt Tac, CASEVAC, CFF 1, CFF 2, CFF 3, TAD, and TACP Local"
1.96734E+17,apparently I have a screenshot backlog
3.06972E+17,I guess you could do CASEVAC requests over CoTac
1.96734E+17,I fucking forgot about the vehicle radios
2.2E+17,@Autismo Primero too large scale
1.96734E+17,that was a trainwreck
1.96734E+17,in a good way
2.2E+17,we never had enough guys to justify that
1.96734E+17,yeah we had <20 dudes most of the time
2.2E+17,@JOBBIN not always
1.96734E+17,"yeah, at the beginning"
1.96734E+17,rip
2.2E+17,end of a2 / start of a3 we regularly pulled 30 ish
2.2E+17,high 20s was low turnout
2.2E+17,"but yeah, never bigger than a max packed platoon plus attached assets"
1.96734E+17,classic
3.06972E+17,"So you could cut CoTac, CASEVAC, and maybe one of the CFF freqs if you wanted to run 60s and 81s on one net"
1.96734E+17,"get in, loser"
1.96734E+17,now I'm gonna dig up old screenshots
1.96734E+17,that one is really good
2.2E+17,"yeah, also no need for casevac because with our ace settings getting sneezed on meant lights out"
1.96734E+17,"yeah, we generally just died"
3.06972E+17,Kek
1.96734E+17,or became a vegetable at the best
3.06972E+17,Nobody wanted to pick up the mantle of CLS?
1.96734E+17,@ironman347 nice haircut
2.2E+17,it was basically down to whether the rest of your squad wanted to rp schleping your limp corpse around for the rest of the mission
2.2E+17,no we had cls
1.96734E+17,sam straight up executed me one time and took my rifle
2.2E+17,but you just got 1 shot straight to actual dead
1.96734E+17,"when I was """"unconscious"""""
2.2E+17,so they didnt have much to do
3.06972E+17,Rest in pepperoni

3.06972E+17,Or JTAC
1.96734E+17,"what do these acronyms mean, funny mareens man"
2.2E+17,our jtac was pretty legit
1.96734E+17,we did have an actual one of those
2.2E+17,we had an actual jtac help us write a paired down version of 9 lines
2.2E+17,i think it ended up being 7

1.96734E+17,OH
1.96734E+17,I think I remember that one
1.96734E+17,we were defending that
2.2E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,it was one of the nam ones
2.2E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,that one I actually didn't die instantly
1.96734E+17,we were resupplying that with helos and stuff

1.96734E+17,we allllll fuckin died
2.2E+17,glory charge
2.2E+17,that would have been the last great arma moment
2.2E+17,if it wasnt for delta force mission
1.96734E+17,the last great moment was the black hawk down mission
1.96734E+17,yeah

2.2E+17,james were you there for the great porta potty funeral?
3.06972E+17,Realistically you only need lines 4-8
2.2E+17,esp in arma
1.96734E+17,I don't think so
1.96734E+17,"was this when we all got rinsed by the """"""PMC"""""" dudes with AUGs?"
1.96734E+17,that was fucking terrifying lmao

1.96734E+17,this one cropped is really good
2.2E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,I found it
1.96734E+17,the vietnam mission where I got clapped instantly
2.2E+17,oh mr mg42's magical tracer zone?
1.96734E+17,I died like 2 mins after this was taken
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,the MG42 man
2.2E+17,or the melander mg murderhole incident
2.2E+17,"man, so many good memories"

1.96734E+17,tragic
1.96734E+17,this was pretty cool ngl
1.96734E+17,they actually scripted a drop pod insertion
2.2E+17,i should make another scripted halo mission
2.2E+17,like the one i did with entirely too many tracers
1.96734E+17,trebuchet memes were always a lot of fun
3.06972E+17,God I miss pod drops
1.96734E+17,but the insurrectionists were fucking terrifying
3.07631E+17,FappApp
3.06972E+17,FUCK
1.96734E+17,since they all had the ARs
1.96734E+17,with GLs and 60 rounders
2.2E+17,give every man a fucking 60 round full auto low recoil 762 gun with a ugl
2.2E+17,what could go wrong
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,for reasons
2.2E+17,space 762 too so it flies unreasonably flat
1.96734E+17,I love trebuchet because it demonstrates how halo gats would have actually kinda functioned
1.96734E+17,instead of how they were balanced in Halo

1.96734E+17,back in the jihad-joe days RIP
8.99591E+16,I recall this
1.96734E+17,that was fun
8.99591E+16,And it just had Erika in it
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,"you know, innocuous German folk music"
8.99591E+16,It was like yodeling and stuff and then suddenly it's playing specifically Nazi German marching songs
1.96734E+17,with no Nazi stuff in it
1.96734E+17,not at all
1.96734E+17,https://youtu.be/j6_6qyLzQnk?t=295

1.96734E+17,I will listen to the Authentic German Folk Music at work
8.99591E+16,"Which, admittedly, isn't actually a Nazi song at all, just a popular folk song used as a marching song (by Nazis)"

8.99591E+16,The vanilla/light mod modes just aren't the same
1.96734E+17,yeah ik what you mean
8.99591E+16,Easy to pick up but not the same
1.96734E+17,modded antistasi was a good compromise
8.99591E+16,Yeah
1.96734E+17,and def very jank
1.96734E+17,but like the right amount of jank
1.96734E+17,mostly
8.99591E+16,I also think ACRE does a *lot* for Arma
1.96734E+17,absolutely
8.99591E+16,Especially in a group over like... 3-4
1.96734E+17,built-in voice is garbage and discord is too hard with more than 3-4 people
8.99591E+16,It's bad having multiple people talking over each other on most platforms but discord completely collapses trying to do that
1.96734E+17,yeah
8.99591E+16,It's a huge perk team speak has over discord
1.96734E+17,voices just compress/drown out
8.99591E+16,"Teamspeak can play everyone speaking at full volume simultaneously, which while may be an assault on the ears, you can still pick stuff out"
1.96734E+17,that was jack every op night
1.96734E+17,he had to spectate/zeus so he heard everyone for hours at a time lmfao
8.99591E+16,Discord has line 3-4 people talk at once and no one understands anything anyone said because it just collapses and can't actually produce sounds
1.96734E+17,no ACRE
8.99591E+16,Yeah lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,yeah I hate that
8.99591E+16,I keep getting reminded of it because we have a new server that's got reasonably active voice chats lately and when there's like 8 people half the time it's unintelligible
1.96734E+17,it just compresses and tears a ton
1.90984E+17,"Ngl all of the arma shenanigans, and nostalgia fpr the old fist days, is what made me wantto join up with viking for op nights"

3.06972E+17,Fucking comm protocol violations
3.06972E+17,Autism level 100
4.05342E+17,I wanted to reimplement acre into mike force
4.05342E+17,Actual having to call iN CAS
4.05342E+17,I want to mod mike force to not show moving map
4.05342E+17,I.e. make it more painful
1.96734E+17,Moving map?
1.96734E+17,Do you mean how it marks enemies on the map?
8.99591E+16,Yeah Mike Force is pretty casual as is
8.99591E+16,A little much for my tastes
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,a lot of it comes down to server/difficulty settings
1.96734E+17,like the crosshairs and how much info the map displays
1.96734E+17,the withstand mechanic is pretty dumb though
8.99591E+16,I hate those mechanics
8.99591E+16,It's very cheesy
8.99591E+16,Also broken
1.96734E+17,yes
1.96734E+17,you basically never die
8.99591E+16,I can just carry a medkit and almost guaranteed get back up
1.96734E+17,unless the AI somehow has the foresight to execute you lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
8.99591E+16,Unless the AI decides to execute me which it usually doesn't
8.99591E+16,Mike Force basically has the opposite problem Antistasi has
8.99591E+16,It's like late game Antistasi where you're just cutting guys down with zero consequence
1.96734E+17,yeah
8.99591E+16,Though with Antistasi there is at least a perpetually looming threat of being bombed into oblivion without a chance
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
1.96734E+17,it's hard to strike a good difficulty balance with antistasi
1.96734E+17,there's that narrow period of time where you're on equal footing with the AI
8.99591E+16,I think Antistasi lends itself to more players than we have
8.99591E+16,Honestly
1.96734E+17,early game is brutal and then late game is trivial
1.96734E+17,yeah that's the other thing
1.96734E+17,you need a lot of people to get a good game going with antistasi
8.99591E+16,There's supposed to be more things going on at any given time
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,that's my other issue with mike force too
8.99591E+16,"And you're supposed to have a decent few guys to assault targets, not like 6 guys with Mosins"
1.96734E+17,the map is basically empty if you're not actively attacking something
8.99591E+16,Yeah
8.99591E+16,If it's not activated
1.96734E+17,"the AI is entirely reactive, they don't do anything on their own accord"
1.96734E+17,but antistasi had patrols and stuff
8.99591E+16,Yeah at least a roadblock placed in some retarded spot could fuck your day up
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
1.96734E+17,it would be cool in mike force if they tried to re-attack points or your FOBs/HQ or something
1.96734E+17,yeah or roadblocks and patrols
1.96734E+17,antistasi checkpoints are hilarious
1.96734E+17,because you'll just be talking on a road trip with the boys and then get pulped
8.99591E+16,I don't like that Mike Force FOBs are literally under attack constantly
8.99591E+16,"Like, why"
1.96734E+17,that part is kinda fun
1.96734E+17,at least when you're setting them up initially
6.00007E+17,This guy moaned **at least** this loud
1.96734E+17,then it starts to get old
8.99591E+16,"It can be but it gets kinda old, like I'd much rather prefer if there was randomly timed assaults"
1.96734E+17,"mike force does the attacks really well though, the AI are relentless and it gets super hectic"
1.96734E+17,"the actual point attacks, not FOB stuff"
8.99591E+16,"Instead it's just kind of a constant stream of guys but not too many guys, with occasionally a bunch"
1.96734E+17,yeah
8.99591E+16,Also I've only really attacked the airfield but it was meh to me
1.96734E+17,it's also entirely infantry
1.96734E+17,would be cool if they had vehicles of any kind
1.96734E+17,the logistics components are really cool though
1.96734E+17,it's fun to transport supplies for bases and stuff
8.99591E+16,I like the base building and logistics for sure

1.96734E+17,"yeah, a lot of it comes down to tweaks"

1.96734E+17,absolutely

1.4321E+17,Bruh how you lose to Anji?
1.29298E+17,No idea what he does
1.4321E+17,You can literally punish his spin with taunting
1.29298E+17,Unless it's a spin on round start type guy
1.4321E+17,Like all of his stuff is ultra minus

1.4321E+17,If he does the aerial projectile off of Fujin you can literally move under him before he throws the fans
1.29298E+17,"He's got like 3 options off Fujin and I don't know what each looks like, he's got a high low and throw so I just panic"
1.29298E+17,O
1.4321E+17,Overhead is pretty slow and both Fujin and the overhead are minus on block
1.29298E+17,"Yeah but I have bad brian, it took me so long to throw leos cross"
1.4321E+17,"It's low sweep, overhead, jump up projectile, or jump forward"
1.4321E+17,If he jumps forward he's gonna throw so you can just throw tech or do like any quick normal to stuff him out
1.29298E+17,This will be usefull when I play another anji next month

3.07631E+17,I cleaned it out today and it still idles at 80. Probably need cold sauce or a @wonpons
1.96734E+17,did you reapply cold sauce? or just throw it raw back onto the CPU die?
3.07631E+17,Raw dogged it
3.07631E+17,I don't have yhe sauce
1.96734E+17,yeah don't do that :verygoodpoint:
1.96734E+17,that would explain your 80c idle
1.96734E+17,truly a @wonpons moment
1.96734E+17,I also have some cold sauce but it's really cheap anyways

3.07631E+17,I will aquire the sauce and report back

3.07631E+17,Ah fug
3.07631E+17,This is literally the 2nd time ive done this but no sauce each time
5.00413E+17,Make sure there's no plastic covering on the cooler btw

3.07631E+17,Does home depo sell the sauce??
1.96734E+17,home depot sells many sauces

3.07631E+17,Do i need to re sauce my cumtendo switch too?
5.00413E+17,Yes

1.96734E+17,like thermal pads
5.00413E+17,There's an easy access port for you to pour new cold sauce in at the top
5.00413E+17,You need to do it once every quarter

1.96734E+17,isopropyl alcohol and a coffee filter
1.96734E+17,any cloth will work but ideally you want something that won't shed a bunch of fibers

2.22167E+17,This party's gettin' crazy
2.42762E+17,~~that's an interesting picture of Lady~~
1.96734E+17,yeah man that;s just official game art of Lady‚Ñ¢Ô∏è from Devil May Cry 3
1.4321E+17,She's like 17 in DMC3
2.22167E+17,Legal in Texas
2.22167E+17,"Today's pro tip: 
Most states have an age of consent under 18. Everyone assumes it's 18 because they're fucking coomers that watch too much porn warnings. It's 18 across states, which is why porn is 18. It's media crossing state lines"
5.00413E+17,"> Today's ~~pro~~ *degenerate* tip:
If you're in this server you definitely shouldn't be going anywhere near someone under 18"
5.00413E+17,unless you play smash I guess
2.22167E+17,I haven't played games in almost a year. What's happened to my life?
5.00413E+17,imagine being an actual adult and not a mentally stunted child who happens to be 25
2.22167E+17,Happens to be 32
5.00413E+17,I was talking about myself
2.22167E+17,You've still got 5 more years before you contemplate suicide
5.00413E+17,and many of the other degenerates I know
2.22167E+17,I can't game because my kode skills are still trash but I want a new job
5.00413E+17,"damn, I game all day because I don't want a new job"
5.00413E+17,and I don't want a new job because I game all day
5.00413E+17,Life is good
2.22167E+17,I had to make a class yesterday that had over 50 variables because for some reason whoever decided the data standards being transported made a shit of of 1 bit fields to represent a bunch of different shit
2.22167E+17,50+ variable constructor. Fuck am I doing with my life?
5.00413E+17,"Not living, that's for sure"
2.22167E+17,"If I wasn't work from home, I might have gone insane already"
2.22167E+17,We got a new guy we hired that came from Microsoft. Seattle must be dogshit if he left them for us
5.00413E+17,Seattle is dogshit and Microsoft is also ass
5.00413E+17,BUT are they as ass as the US government? Not sure
2.22167E+17,They probably pay more and have better benefits
5.00413E+17,> Me implying that microsoft and the US government aren't practically the same thing
5.00413E+17,pay and benefits aren't everything
2.22167E+17,"We're on contract work, so we can't even really get raises"
2.22167E+17,Really can't stay at any defense company for longer than maybe 1-2 years.
2.22167E+17,Unless it's a fuckin huge one like Raytheon or Lockheed
5.00413E+17,"I have a moral compass, couldn't work for a defense company lmao"
2.22167E+17,I watch Anime. I have no morals
2.22167E+17,Been sucking government teat since I turned 18. Hard to escape now
2.22167E+17,Unless I pass these fuckin code interviews
8.99591E+16,why is some of the text so small
5.00413E+17,tbh I would work for a defense company if I really couldn't find another job
2.22167E+17,It matches your penis size
5.00413E+17,"I gotta eat, if kids have to die overseas for that to happen, so be it"
8.99591E+16,he lied
2.22167E+17,"I've got a mortgage, car loan and cocaine habit. I need cash"

3.07631E+17,your deep rock hours are pussy shit @JohnnyTarr
4.94592E+17,(Clean)
1.4321E+17,Unedited picture of Luke from the SF6 website
1.96734E+17,it looks good
2.22167E+17,It looks gay
2.22167E+17,"Same vibe, though"
1.96734E+17,visuals and art direction are way better than sfv imo
1.96734E+17,capcom tried to hold onto that weird stylized 3d aesthetic with sf4 and 5
1.96734E+17,everyone just looked like cavemen
2.22167E+17,I don't like Luke in general. Doesn't look like an SF character
1.96734E+17,"what does an SF character even ""look"" like at this point though"
1.96734E+17,he's nothing if not just as sterotypical as all the other SF characters lmao
1.96734E+17,he's a generic dudebro MMA man
2.22167E+17,"A certain level of exaggeration to make them distinct, but not enough to be a KoF character"
1.96734E+17,he has that
1.96734E+17,he has the zoomer hair and the weird inflation arms
2.22167E+17,"To be fair, a lot of SF5 newcomers haven't looked like a typical SF character"
1.96734E+17,I like his new design way more than whatever they were doing with SFV luke
1.96734E+17,pain
2.22167E+17,I hate Zoomer hair but that's even worse
1.96734E+17,that just looks a bit less retardo to me
1.96734E+17,than his sfv look
2.22167E+17,"Yes, but he looks kinda plain."
1.96734E+17,the whataburger top is a bit weird
1.96734E+17,sf characters are plain as fuck
1.96734E+17,especially the OG roster
1.96734E+17,KOF is the series with all the dripped out Kpop characters
1.96734E+17,FEET
1.96734E+17,"idk, I like the new art direction with all of the graffiti/paint motifs"
1.96734E+17,STREET fighter
1.96734E+17,the last time SF experimented with wacko characters was SF3
2.22167E+17,"If you look at the original World Warriors, you could look at them and tell what they're about before you played anything. That's sometimes kept true for newer characters"
1.96734E+17,I mean I feel like I understand that Luke is dudebro MMA man from a glance
1.96734E+17,he has the haircut and the gloves
1.96734E+17,and a sleeveless hoodie
2.22167E+17,Is that what his character is in-game? I don't know
1.96734E+17,yeah
1.96734E+17,he's apparently an ex-PMC/mil dude that does MMA now lmao
1.96734E+17,so basically zoomer guile
2.22167E+17,Joe Rogan
1.96734E+17,yes
2.22167E+17,Should be a gorilla
1.96734E+17,but with hair and less DMT/weed
2.22167E+17,"Then he conveys his image, but Dudebro MMA fighter isn't an image I ever wanted to see in SF"
1.96734E+17,Yeah fair
1.96734E+17,It is a style that's kinda been left out though
2.22167E+17,"My personal favorite is Juri being an evil Korean bitch and FANG being a sneaky, lying Chinaman. Never change, Japan"
1.96734E+17,Not that sf ever sticks to that stuff super firmly
1.96734E+17,I guess dudebro MMA man is more of a Tekken thing
2.22167E+17,"Yeah, I see him in Tekken"
1.96734E+17,But that's basically paul
2.22167E+17,Not fighting the evil guy who wants the body of a 16 year old girl and has an army of 16 year old girls
2.22167E+17,"Damn, SF is fucking weird"
2.22167E+17,"Tekken has its oddity humor, but Panda, Kuma and Roger are more in line with Tekken level of weird. Alissa was really pushing it. She's probably a little too out there. Still like her cause I'm a weeaboo, though"
1.96734E+17,Tekken went mega off the rails with 6
1.96734E+17,5 kinda also
1.96734E+17,I feel like 4 was the last time it was semi-dark/serious
1.96734E+17,And Paul was still an actual character and not just meme man
2.22167E+17,Only Guilty Gear kept the spirit. Anime fuckin weirdos
1.96734E+17,japan
2.22167E+17,Gunman with cum jar
1.96734E+17,I find the American yeehaw character archetypes weirdly endearing
1.96734E+17,Even GG has one now
1.96734E+17,With gold dick
2.22167E+17,I miss when Americans were Ken and not Rufus
1.96734E+17,Yes
1.96734E+17,Rufus is actually the worst character in the entire series
2.22167E+17,I wouldn't be upset if he never returned. Somehow worse than Remy. Remy is lame
2.22167E+17,"Capcom: What if Guile was gay?

- long hair
- tight jeans
- **French**"
1.96734E+17,I completely forgot about Remy
2.22167E+17,It's for the best
1.96734E+17,european man ü§Æ
2.22167E+17,Luke should've been Filipino and be an MMA Nutshack douchebag
1.96734E+17,lmao
2.22167E+17,Alt costume is just a wife beater
1.96734E+17,very chad
1.4321E+17,The paint effects in fights feel like a great evolution from SF4
1.96734E+17,I like the spraypaint because it makes me hungry
1.96734E+17,I want to eat it
1.4321E+17,Also Luke is a gamer and commits war crimes according to his bio on the SF6 website
1.96734E+17,I want to spray the paint into my mouth and call poison control
1.96734E+17,wow he's literally me fr
1.96734E+17,dude is he part of blackwater
2.22167E+17,Luke is the self-imagined version of themselves gamer bros have
1.96734E+17,"finally, a fortnite rep in street fighter"
1.96734E+17,https://tenor.com/view/epic-win-fortnite-ryu-street-fighter-dance-gif-20536517
2.22167E+17,"Damn, I believe I can commit war crimes, game all day, contribute nothing to society, yet still be over 6ft tall and buff"
1.96734E+17,"I mean if you contribute nothing to society, you prob have a ton of time to LIFT brother"
2.22167E+17,But that's precious cooming time lost
2.22167E+17,Now I hate Luke even more because they're trying so hard to make him a self-insert relatable Zoomer
2.22167E+17,In my day we related to green Brazilian wild men who shot electricity and stretchy Indian men who wore children's skulls around his neck
3.07631E+17,FORTNITe

1.4321E+17,Can't believe the one thing capcom had to do to get me interested in SF again was to make it have style for the first time since 3rd strike
1.96734E+17,I mean sf4 had style
1.29298E+17,Is sf6 confirmed rollback?
1.96734E+17,There was definitely an art direction despite the he-man character models
1.96734E+17,No idea but I'd assume Capcom would have it considering arcsys and SNK are doing so
1.96734E+17,"Then again, Tekken doesn't have rollback lmao"
6.00007E+17,dude XD

1.4321E+17,Gimmick that leads to rushdown
1.4321E+17,The further you are the more concetration you waste when shooting
1.4321E+17,So you just use zoning to give yourself an opening for unga with new combo routes

1.96734E+17,"Thoughts racing from my head to my fingernails
They keep coming like a hammer pounding on my brain
Gotta fight it, gotta hold on to the sanity
But there's a rage burning slowly deep inside of me

I'm being swallowed by confusion
Lost between the truth and my insatiable delusion
Just my pride or is it just a bunch of lies
I don't care but I just gotta find myself a place to fight

But I can taste it, the sweet seduction
Another type of anger and it's holding me for ransom
My state of mind is going blind
I'm losing grip of every other truth that I could ever find

Uh, I'm searching for the reason
My mind is on the journey but I'm quickly running out of time
Storm is rising on my horizon
My fate is coming at the speed of light"
1.96734E+17,"Don't stay
Within
The dark
When hope fades

Don't walk
Away
From the light
Your destiny awaits


Words grip me like the chains of a prison cell
Cutting deep through the skin and my dignity
I find myself, I lose myself
I'm looking for something to hold on to in the darkness

But I'm never giving in
No I'm never giving up
That's just how it's gonna be
When it all goes down


Don't stay
Within
The dark
When hope fades

Don't walk
Away
From the light
Forevermore

Then stay
Within
Dark
When hope fades

Don't be
Afraid
Of the dark
Your destiny awaits


Head spinning with a storm reaching in my mind
Like I've fallen in a never-ending river tide
Thoughts betrayed and leave me here in solitude
Nothing left now but the flames burning in my eyes

I hit the ground with a thunder like you've never seen
I'm super and I've got fists of pride, burning at my sides
And nothing's gonna take me down
When it's time for me to stand and fight"

1.29298E+17,@wonpons b one 1. Hiw you supposed to set x = a^(p-1)/4 is p - 1 = 30
1.29298E+17,Is it supposed to be p+1
3.07631E+17,this p is p === 3 mod 4
3.07631E+17,so try x ^ (p+1)/4
3.07631E+17,yes p+1

5.00413E+17,Hey Leilani what'd you get for number 3 on the crypto homework
3.07631E+17,2 is free
1.29298E+17,I just plugged numbers in because I was afraid to mess with polynomials in with a mod
1.29298E+17,"Also i think the answer is 2 expected answers under lagrange Thorne, because {-4, 15} {-6, 13} are the same mod 19"

3.07631E+17,i just solved the system of equations and mod p did absolutely nothing
3.07631E+17,very cool
3.07631E+17,i got -10 instead of 391
3.07631E+17,but w/e üí¶

1.29298E+17,"Those cards are at it again. The quest to cut down the complexity of possible primes
in Wonderland continues. Having been previously burnt modulo 4 the Queen of Hearts
decided to move to modulo 6; henceforth only those primes of the form p ‚â° 1 (mod 6)

would be used in Wonderland. The existence of all others would be denied. The Queen of
course checked and indeed there seemed to be many such values; 7, 19, 31, 37, . . ..

Of course ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or ‚Äústrong primes‚Äù were still desirable and the White Rabbit was set

3.07631E+17,"[5] It is 2119 and the world has become more anti-intellectual. Academics are even less in
favour and, in particular, mathematicians are viewed as public enemy number 1. As a
result, groups with suspected intellectual leanings are rounded up, arrested and told they
will be forced to play the following game the next morning.
Groups of size three are formed, blindfolded and then each member receives a hat that is
either white or black and this will be done completely at random and independently. At asignal the blindfolds are removed and each person can see the other individual‚Äôs hats but
not their own. The group members must simultaneously guess the color of their own hat
or pass. No communication of any sort will be allowed at this stage. They will be set free
only if there is at least one non-pass and there are no incorrect answers. What should they
do to maximize their chances?
1. There is an obvious strategy with a 50% chance of winning. What is that?
2. At a strategy session the night before one mathematician comes up with the following:
‚ÄúEither all hats are the same colour or they are mixed, two of one or one of the
other and the latter is the most probable. Thus if one of us sees two hats of opposite
colours we can add nothing - we just pass. But one of us must see two hats of the
same colour and to be in the set with larger probability should declare their hat is
of the opposite colour.‚Äù
Can you follow this thread and see if it indeed gives a better strategy?
3. What on earth has this to do with M471?? But figure this out before proceeding to the
next question."

""Why is it asking for a password?"", Because you're logging into something, Martha. That's how it's been for the last 20 fucking years. ""How do I do this, Can you show me?"" No, Dale, you can Google it like the rest of us. It requires one exposure to the concept of googling to understand how it works. Your generation was smart enough to cause a total economic collapse out of malice, but not smart enough to type in a few words, I guess. ""I'm not tech savvy"", No, you just refuse to learn like in most things, you are stuck in your ways. The worst part is after you help an old fuck with sort of tech bullshit 9 times out of 10, they'll give you some kind of bullshit passive-aggressive thank you along the lines of ""Oh, I guess you young people have to know something about those phones you're always on, huh?"". Give me a fucking break Gretchen, I have depression from living in the economy you created and my phone is more of a reprieve than dealing with your stubborn, inconsiderate ass. AND ANOTHER THING that just gets my blood boiling is their ability to get into their settings, completely fuck things up, and then manage to develop total amnesia about how it happened. What do you mean you set your phone to Japanese on accident, Phil? There's like 15 separate menus you have to navigate through to get there. ""I think it's because I got a virus"". No, Greg, It's not a virus, the only viruses here are your rampant stupidity and the deadly pathogens carried by your unvaccinated grandchildren. I just absolutely loathe that the people who decide if women should be executed for having abortions or not are the same people who can't figure out how to work a blu-ray player with the instructions right in front of them."

1.96734E+17,But apparently every smash player is American so rip
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Only the US matters for smash reps

1.96734E+17,Yeah he's gotta fix his head peg
1.96734E+17,Lmao
1.96734E+17,What if Terry is just Ken with a hat
1.4321E+17,Like Incineroar beats K. Rool and villager and stuff then holds his belt up
1.4321E+17,Terry walks in and adjusts his hat
1.4321E+17,Then fighting montage and part way through it shows him get his ass kicked then it goes back to the prerendered trailer and his hat falls off and Ken tosses it back to him
1.4321E+17,Then it shows his final smash or something
1.96734E+17,yes

2.22167E+17,Keep fucking up and they'll start punishing you with Boomer jokes
1.4321E+17,Don't work security

3.36877E+17,In my new hire orientation
3.36877E+17,The guy running it was like ‚Äúwho here is from Texas?‚Äù and he went around the room asking for schools everyone went to and once I heard that... voice... I knew exactly who it was

2.22167E+17,"Lockheed is paid per employee by the government. Say they get like $200,000 per person hired. Whatever your salary is gets subtracted from that, then they pocket the difference"
2.22167E+17,"Firing someone always loses them money, even if they're Nick"
2.22167E+17,Two people got fired here. One for faking hours 2 days (didn't even show up. Madlad!) in a row and another got arrested. Guess I just need to do better than that

4.09038E+17,"My dear friends, It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you of the gravest of news. Once upon a time a man so evil, so ingenious stalked our class rooms. Wearing naught but his black suit and balding hair he proselytized the folly of interrupts and introduced us to the evil that is the Buddy System. He tortured many, beating them publicly. Others he would threaten with his icy gaze and evil wit. For two years we have lived without fear of this mighty creature, but alas he has returned. I tell you this day Riccardo ""Salami Allocator"" Bettatti has returned to the podium. 

With the knowledge of this grave threat, I would ask each of you consider joining us, once again, in his Semaphorical Charnal House. We shall offer up the ancient ritual of Boozy Bettatti and pray that he passes over us once more. Now please remember to repeat the 5 reasons not to use interrupts 15 times and curse at a phone using child at least once.  Least ye be cursed.

In Bettatti's Name, 
GoofyCoin"

4.09038E+17,@JOBBIN getting lunch is SUPER unhealthy. Just eat one shoe every morning. That will set you straight and provide much needed rubber and fiber for your diet

1.96734E+17,That was a big wake-up call boss
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Have you fought nightmare yet?
1.96734E+17,No
1.4321E+17,Enjoy fighting him 3 times
1.4321E+17,He's fucking awful
1.96734E+17,I stopped not long after griffon
1.4321E+17,How do you like fighting shadow?
1.4321E+17,That's the weird panther enemy
1.4321E+17,Oh yeah jump cancelling exists in dmc1 but it's limited to only the shotgun
1.96734E+17,Shadow was fine once I figured out the gimmick
1.4321E+17,Griffon is best dmc1 character that returns in dmc5
1.96734E+17,Hell yes
1.96734E+17,Feather face
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN bruh Terry is the first character with a back special
1.4321E+17,And you can do power dunk and burn knuckle freely if you'rw above 100%
1.96734E+17,Back special as in separate side-b when pressing the opposite direction you're facing?
1.96734E+17,Nice
1.96734E+17,How does that work if it's not a 1v1 though
1.4321E+17,I haven't tried it yet
1.4321E+17,Bruh they put so much love into Terry
1.4321E+17,"Only thing I'm sad about is now CvS music, but there are 50 tracks to choose from still"
1.96734E+17,üôÅ
1.96734E+17,Probably copyright related
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,Capcom developed CVS 1&2
1.96734E+17,I think it was the same director that did DMC 3-5
1.4321E+17,Also there are 20 characters that can cameo on the KoF stage
1.96734E+17,Itsuno
1.4321E+17,And Mai isn't one of them
1.96734E+17,Looool I hear
1.4321E+17,Sakurai said smash is only for good boys and girls
1.96734E+17,Heard*
1.96734E+17,But Blue Mary is in
1.4321E+17,I mean at least her clothes are less revealing
1.4321E+17,Also Terry's final smash is amazing
1.4321E+17,Triple power geyser into power dunk then buster wolf
1.96734E+17,oh yes
1.96734E+17,Terry is so cool
1.4321E+17,Also if you do a power dunk he actually puts his hat on backwards
1.4321E+17,Also he has 4 versions of his specials besides power wave
1.4321E+17,Whatever direction you tilt the stick plus tapping üÖ± or holding üÖ±
1.4321E+17,Then doing the input and tapping or holding üÖ±
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Thank you Terminus
1.4321E+17,Oh and you can cancel any jab or tilt with special inputs
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,And like 2 aerials can be cancelled too
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN so Terry actually walks backwards like in a standard fighting game
1.96734E+17,Oh wow
1.96734E+17,Even when not in 1v1s?
1.4321E+17,I haven't tested outside of training
1.4321E+17,But I'd think so
1.4321E+17,"Walking in the direction you aren't facing makes you backstep, then you actually turn around when you dash"
1.96734E+17,Does he have proper fighting game inputs?
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,Thanks terminus
1.4321E+17,Yep
1.4321E+17,Besides for powerwave
1.4321E+17,"Rising tackle, burn knuckle, crackshoot, power dunk, power geyser, and buster wolf all have inputs"
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Thank you terminus
1.96734E+17,Sick
1.4321E+17,Power Geyser and Buster Wolf can only be done at 100%+ tho
1.96734E+17,So it's like a desperation move
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,Did he get any alt costumes?
1.4321E+17,Sadly no
1.4321E+17,They're all the hat and vest
1.4321E+17,Some change what his hat says
1.4321E+17,One has NEO GEO on his hat
1.96734E+17,Damn
1.96734E+17,Would have loved a garou costume
1.4321E+17,I'll have to double check but I think he at least has a brown alt
1.4321E+17,And he has his point taunt from garou
1.4321E+17,Oh fuck
1.4321E+17,If you start to dash away he actually does a backstep before transitioning into his sprint
1.96734E+17,Nice
1.4321E+17,Lmao you can kinda moonwalk if you try to dash dance
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.96734E+17,I'll have to get a switch eventually
1.4321E+17,Jeez the long press input for burn knuckle is nasty
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,**_BAHN NACKHOO_**
1.4321E+17,Buster Wolf does 30%
1.96734E+17,Owo
6.00007E+17,what's this?
1.4321E+17,And of course he says the line
1.96734E+17,Busta nut
1.4321E+17,Power Geyser is a little jank to pull off on a controller tho
1.96734E+17,Is it the original kof input?
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,The back quarter circle into the diagonal forward
1.96734E+17,‚¨áÔ∏è‚ÜôÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚ÜôÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è
1.96734E+17,That?
1.4321E+17,ye
1.96734E+17,Fuck that
1.96734E+17,Seems like you might accidentally jump or dash when going down-back to forward
1.4321E+17,"There's simplified inputs for both his super specials, but I forgot what power geyser's was"
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,I know you can do down forward down forward for buster wolf
1.96734E+17,Nice
1.4321E+17,Also if you're beneath an opponent on a platform in a 1v1 you automatically turn to face them when you go underneath them
1.4321E+17,So you quarter circle inputs flip like in a fighting game when you get put to the opposite side
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Terminus is broken I think
1.96734E+17,No that's normal
1.96734E+17,The trigger word is np
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,"(any text that contains np, like input)"
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Oh
1.96734E+17,It's an insider meme from one of our old class discussion boards
1.96734E+17,There was a post titled just `np`
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Oh hey Terry has a yellow alt where his hat has a wolf on it and it says hungry wolf
1.96734E+17,And the only comment was `discovered`
1.96734E+17,Nice
1.4321E+17,17 new remixes on the SNK stage
1.96734E+17,:commando:
1.4321E+17,Also the characters that appear in the background change depending on the music playing
1.96734E+17,Marco????
1.4321E+17,Like Iori pops up when stormy sax is playing
1.96734E+17,Fuck yes
1.4321E+17,Marco doesn't show up tho
1.96734E+17,Chad reverse-mullet Iori
1.4321E+17,Also Terry has a counter mechanic
1.96734E+17,Of course
1.4321E+17,It's way cooler than just press down b
1.4321E+17,You can do a unique attack directly out of a spot dodge that gives you iframes on your upper body
1.96734E+17,Oh nice
1.96734E+17,I forget kof had rolling
1.96734E+17,And spot dodging
1.96734E+17,And short hops
1.96734E+17,Was kof actually smash the whole time??
1.4321E+17,Yes
1.96734E+17,:kaz:
1.96734E+17,Now we just need Tekken 1 kazuya to complete the fighters
1.4321E+17,The only move that is unique to smash is Terry's up air
1.4321E+17,Everything else is taken directly from his standard fatal fury moveset
1.4321E+17,Oh you can cancel dair into power dunk:commando:
1.4321E+17,Oh yeah Terry's stage is pretty weird
1.4321E+17,It's flat but it doesn't have walk offs
1.96734E+17,Weird
1.4321E+17,It has invisible walls on the edge like a fighting game
1.4321E+17,And if you get knocked into them hard enough you get thrown out
1.96734E+17,So it's like Shadow Moses but not retarded
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,Remember that time the guard towers grew out of the ground in MGS1?
1.4321E+17,Yeah man
1.4321E+17,Nanomachines are crazy
6.00007E+17,"No, Snake - the nanomachines are functioning fine! It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis, FOXHOUND's psychic."
1.4321E+17,Oh my god the animation for power dunk is amazing
1.4321E+17,Terry twists his hat back as he jumps upwards
1.96734E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,That was in the original spritework too
1.4321E+17,Yep
1.96734E+17,:kaz:
1.96734E+17,:emoji_42:
1.4321E+17,@JOBBIN the fact that you can cancel any jab combo into a special or command input on terry is fucking amazing
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,The first 2 hits of your jab combo into power geyser is a hilarious meme
1.96734E+17,Nice
1.4321E+17,He's really fun
1.96734E+17,He seems like it
1.96734E+17,I need to get a switch eventually
1.4321E+17,I might come back to Houston before thanksgiving
1.4321E+17,Depends on these papers I need to write
1.96734E+17,üëå
1.4321E+17,My one issue is some the command inputs being janky and using your bair is hard since you always turn to face your opponent
6.00007E+17,discovered
4.94592E+17,Thank you Terminus
1.96734E+17,There's probably some form of input buffering for his commands
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,Samurai showed off some simplified inputs
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,It's mostly geyser and dunk that I fuck up
1.96734E+17,But they looked harder lol
1.4321E+17,I think it's just dumbing down the idea of the inputs for smashlets that have never seen a quarter circle before
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.96734E+17,Shoryuken motions can be hard on analog sticks
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,I've only done power dunk inputs on accident
6.00007E+17,discovered
4.94592E+17,You are just onpoint Terminus!
6.00007E+17,discovered
4.94592E+17,he
1.96734E+17,Terminus is just now finding out about Terry
4.94592E+17,What a blessing
1.4321E+17,Tbh I've found power geyser easier to do by just doing to sloppy backwards quarter circles
1.96734E+17,Think of power gayser as a back and forth motion
1.96734E+17,Like half circle back to half circle forward
1.4321E+17,Yeah I know how it's supposed to work
1.4321E+17,It just doesn't work right for me
1.96734E+17,Rip
1.4321E+17,And jank double back works
1.96734E+17,Interesting
1.4321E+17,I think it's just that I hate quarter circles to the left on controller
1.96734E+17,Yeah mirroring inputs can be weird

1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.96734E+17,Joe is like all half circles and shoryukens
1.96734E+17,Terry's dash attack is a half circle input usually
1.4321E+17,When are we getting pretzel inputs?
6.00007E+17,discovered
6.00007E+17,discovered
1.4321E+17,Yeah
1.4321E+17,Wait
1.96734E+17,It's cool that you can still charge rising tackle too
1.4321E+17,Power Geyser can hit the top platform

2.22167E+17,they're just a mom and pop missile store
2.22167E+17,family owned and operated. Made with local munitions
1.96734E+17,Big Boss would be proud
2.22167E+17,"Shit, I misread my offer letter at Raytheon. They listed my annual salary by adding in the compensation package. I don't use their health insurance, so that doesn't count for me. I'm not actually making what I thought. This is a Nick level blunder"
6.00007E+17,nicc*
1.29298E+17,How did you just notice you're getting paid less
2.22167E+17,Didn't do the math. Only read the annualized number
1.29298E+17,So the 2692 is including insurance?
1.29298E+17,It adds up the 70k
1.29298E+17,That's weird that they would include it though
1.29298E+17,Kind of misleading imo
2.22167E+17,only weird until you consider that they're trying to trick you
2.22167E+17,"$2692.80 * 2 * 12 = $64,627.20"

1.29298E+17,Not 1st and 15th
1.29298E+17,"I get paid the same way, theres 3 checks two months of the year"
2.22167E+17,which 2 months?
1.29298E+17,Depends when you get paid
1.29298E+17,"I get my check every other Thursday, october ended up have 3 paydays"
1.29298E+17,Next one is in April for me
2.22167E+17,I need to enter this into my phone calendar to figure out. Don't want to do this manually
1.96734E+17,you'll get your rent when you **_FIX THIS DAMN DOOR_**
2.22167E+17,fix your life!
1.29298E+17,What day do you get paid
2.22167E+17,technically Thursday but my bank deposits it Wednesday
1.29298E+17,Did you get paid yesterday?
2.22167E+17,nah
2.22167E+17,last week
1.29298E+17,January
1.29298E+17,You should be getting 3
2.22167E+17,"ah, so I gotta wait till January"
1.29298E+17,Idk you might have gotten one already
1.29298E+17,That's just the next
2.22167E+17,"works out fine then. I know that some companies do actually pull that weaseling shit and add benefits, then list the total compensation, rather than the pay"
2.22167E+17,thought they might have gotten me
1.29298E+17,"I've seen 401k matching added into the total, but the anual was always listed as well"

1.81573E+17,There‚Äôs 52 workweeks in the year for a total of 26 pay periods. When you hit one of those months where you get payed 3 times between rent payments it feels so good
1.81573E+17,Also I thought Uncle Sam was paying your contractor 200k for you to be sitting at your desk so I figured you got at least half that
1.81573E+17,You‚Äôre getting ripped off here
2.22167E+17,I don't have enough experience to ask for more of that pie
2.22167E+17,"But since it does work that way, it's easier to fuck around at work"
1.81573E+17,Are the executives taking the money that‚Äôs left on the table? Or are they using it to buy equipment and pay for manufacturing and stuff
2.22167E+17,"considering all the Suburbans in the parking lot when the top management visited a month ago, I'd say using it to buy sweet rides"

1.96734E+17,I've been debating on this one for a while now
1.96734E+17,mechanical (browns aren't loud) and split layout is pretty portable/ergonomic
1.96734E+17,you can also get some parts to prop the keyboard up in the middle for ergos

1.96734E+17,And postfix increment means it's incremented after the print statement executes?
1.96734E+17,Tbf static variables outside a class is never really done
1.29298E+17,I never bothered with static vars until here. Apparently its marginally faster than a local var
1.29298E+17,Since you only reserve the memory once I guess
1.96734E+17,Guess you're not a real 10xer unless you optimize your variable initialization
1.96734E+17,Can't take the performance penalty of declaring an extra int per function call
1.29298E+17,I had a unit test failing last week because some 10xer wanted all of the vars to be static
1.96734E+17,That's super dangerous lmao
6.00007E+17,dude XD
1.29298E+17,Manger said fuck that just make them local
1.96734E+17,Yes
1.96734E+17,We had the same thing in our mobile app
1.96734E+17,A bunch of static vars were accidentally getting overwritten
1.96734E+17,But it was because the devs didn't know what static variables did
1.96734E+17,Instead of Xtreme optimization
1.29298E+17,"I get static methods, static vars are big yikes"
1.96734E+17,Especially outside a class
1.96734E+17,It's a holdover from C style stuff I guess
1.29298E+17,More global variables please
1.96734E+17,I like it when my local variables aren't local
1.96734E+17,But at least I save those 4 bytes
1.29298E+17,why have classes and methods when you can make everything global and inside of main
1.96734E+17,Ok but what the fuck does this addSeeds() method do?

1.4321E+17,Also he has an instagram
1.81573E+17,My favorite quote from him was ‚Äúwhen I was young I loved girls who smoke. Because you know what it means if girls smoke? It means they also SUCK DICK‚Äù
1.81573E+17,Something about how he was a sinner
1.81573E+17,But that‚Äôs all I remember

2.22167E+17,How much did any of you guys actually do leetcode shit to land a job?
3.07631E+17,i was in 3 meme songs
3.07631E+17,out of 8
5.00413E+17,"I did some leetcode to prep for interviews, my current company had me do a timed coding challenge online to screen me before my onsite interview (basically 3 leetcode questions) and asked me at least 2 coding questions at the onsite interview that were also on the leetcode website"
5.00413E+17,So I'd say leetcode was a pretty big help in practicing the thinking patterns that helped me land this job
5.00413E+17,"And today I sit, listening to a podcast, having a beer, getting paid to chat with you jokers on discord"
2.22167E+17,4 years of A&M paid off
2.22167E+17,5+ because you jokers didn't finish in 4
1.96734E+17,It depends a lot on the company's interview process I'd imagine
1.96734E+17,It's helpful in general because abstract problem solving skills
1.96734E+17,But Cisco didn't make me do any koder questions surprisingly
1.96734E+17,Anything startup-related/more techy like Michael's area will probably throw programming problems at you
2.22167E+17,My year at Raytheon is almost over. In June I'm jumping for a new signing bonus. I'll have met the requirements to keep it by then

5.00413E+17,"My company was smart enough to give me stock options that vest over 4 years, so I am shackled for the time being"
5.00413E+17,But also I need to learn to be a competent employee so it's a good idea to stay a while
2.22167E+17,"My 401k vested immediately and I only needed 1 year for the bonus. Not going to say Raytheon is the best learning environment. There was a lack of experienced people due to some contract failures a few years ago. They got their dick slapped by Uncle Sam, so they lost a lot of contracts and people left"

2.22167E+17,Has anyone asked you to reverse a linked list?
2.22167E+17,"I got this on LinkedIn. Sounds good, but the recruiters on LinkedIn seem full of shit. Anyone have a good experience with em?"
2.22167E+17,Seems like they just throw out made up bullshit offers or something
1.96734E+17,It seems better than the recruiter spam I usually get (doesn't seem copy-pasted/no huge grammar errors)
1.96734E+17,It's kinda buzzwordy but that's most recruiters
5.00413E+17,"That seems like a huge compensation package, which may or may not be suspicious, but the rest of it actually looks reasonable"
5.00413E+17,Seems worth pursuing
2.22167E+17,"It's contract work, which means low stability. Probably the reason why"
5.00413E+17,"Ah, that makes sense. Also possibly no benefits package/more tax liability if it's actually contractor work. I'd say that all seems pretty reasonable then"
2.22167E+17,"AWS contract work is crazy money, according to the guy who sits next to me at work. He's an AWS contractor. Gets paid $140,00 a year"
2.22167E+17,He's 29. I'm jealous
2.22167E+17,"He says AWS contract roles will pay like $80,000 for 4 months of work sometimes"
5.00413E+17,Yeah that's not too crazy to me. It's the 60k+ profit share and the 20%+ bonus annually that surprised me from that message lmao
5.00413E+17,"Oh damn $80k for 4 months, sign me up"
5.00413E+17,That'll pay for 8 months of playing Minecraft in my underwear before I have to start working again
2.22167E+17,Fuck yeah
2.22167E+17,AWS cert has to be renewed annually
2.22167E+17,You take the test again every time. No wonder it pays so much
1.81573E+17,"$125 is like 2-3 years of experience as a software engineer in DC because of the cost of living. I bet starting is around $100 for a lot of places, especially now that amazon moved here. But if they place you up in DC I‚Äôll show you the patriot‚Äôs room inside the Masonic temple"

2.22167E+17,"I love Master Chief, Xbox and have a porn folder dedicated to Cortana"
4.09038E+17,Need to talk about your Minecraft Creeper porn too.
4.09038E+17,And we host most of Blizzrds servers so an Overwatch reference isn't out of place.
2.22167E+17,"Mercy is a terrible character, but my porn folder of her is still huge regardless"
2.22167E+17,"What even is their culture, for real"
4.09038E+17,"Lol. In all seriousness you will get that question and knowing the motto and the ""five points"" is important. Hitting them is directly linked to compensation (e.g. I had to fill out my diversity goals in my connect)"

4.09038E+17,I like that one better. I talked about going to AA culture conferences for my connect last summer...
4.09038E+17,"""Conferences"" is a strong word. It was meet and greets for BAM (Blacks at Microsoft) and they served free beer."
2.22167E+17,"You're the blackest dude I know, Nic"
4.09038E+17,"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I learned about the Nubian kings and apparently there's a theory that a bunch of Pharaohs were black. It was cool and informative if a bit uncomfortable during that whole ""And here are the 400 years where we were slaves"" bit"
2.22167E+17,Why can't we just watch Wayans bros movies and bury the hatchet?
4.09038E+17,Because WAM (Weebs At Microsoft) would get mad
2.22167E+17,"Pharaohs weren't black, though. I don't do that Kangz shit"
2.22167E+17,Is there really WAM there?
4.09038E+17,"There is but it's Women At Microsoft. There's another group called Anime-Something-Something at Microsoft that a bunch of the interns were into. 

They did screenings of different movies/tv shows every day in one of the giant conference centers on campus. Surprisingly it's got like 58/42 split of Men/Women."
4.09038E+17,(You can look at demographics like that online I did not go and count people)
2.22167E+17,"If the Anime group there likes SAO and Boruto, I'm going to have to pass"
4.09038E+17,I know nothing of this. They did not serve free beer therefore I did not go.

2.22167E+17,Position isn't in Washington. Guess I won't see Nic even if I get hired
4.09038E+17,That's definitely the JEDI contract. You should. It actually elevates your profile when multiple people refer you.
4.09038E+17,"I actually work with some people in Reston because some of our Cloud Architecture (Hardware architecture, not software) work out of their"

1.96734E+17,Wow rip
1.96734E+17,That's lame
2.22167E+17,"The recruiter told me we'd speak Friday, so what the fuck?"
2.22167E+17,This is why Xbox is shit
2.22167E+17,Least I still have the Google interview scheduled. No diss on @Nic  Hemstreet but fuck Microsoft. This is the 3rd time their recruiters have fucked with me
2.22167E+17,And within 3 months
2.22167E+17,Even the Master Chief Collection was less of a shit show than this
1.96734E+17,Microsoft is the Halo 5 of recruiters
2.22167E+17,Friendship with Microsoft ended. Temple OS is my new best friend
5.00413E+17,Low key there's a sweet-ass racing game on TempleOS

1.96734E+17,Stroustrup would be proud
2.22167E+17,They don't even ask for transcripts now that I've graduated. 3.4 for nothing
2.22167E+17,UT does CS Masters online now
2.22167E+17,"If I got to both schools, do I become an Ascended Aggie?"

2.22167E+17,Technically if your company pays the tuition they are
1.96734E+17,Lmao
2.22167E+17,One company I was applying to said they only reimburse 100% of the tuition for an A
2.22167E+17,Fuck them
3.07631E+17,apply to aig
3.07631E+17,they hire anyone who can breathe
2.22167E+17,I'm not desperate for a job. Just greedy
3.07631E+17,they give new hires 2 days of pto per month
3.07631E+17,that's greeeeed
3.07631E+17,you could take off 2/3's of every friday a year
2.22167E+17,What's the catch working there? Besides insurance software being boring as fuck
3.07631E+17,you have to master the indian accent
2.22167E+17,I don't like the curry smell everywhere

2.22167E+17,"Raytheon has tons of Indians too, which I don't even get. How are you cleared?"
2.22167E+17,4 members on my team were Indian old ladies. They straight up don't get American humor
3.07631E+17,indian humor is great tho
3.07631E+17,my boss says im going to move to india one day and become one of them
2.22167E+17,The ladies fake laugh at the sarcastic jokes our manager makes because they clearly don't understand giving each other shit as humor
3.07631E+17,aig indians are top teir indian
3.07631E+17,that's the answer
2.22167E+17,Are they dudes?
2.22167E+17,That might be the difference
3.07631E+17,mostly dudes
3.07631E+17,plenty of desi females tho
2.22167E+17,I'm with a bunch of Indian moms
2.22167E+17,I think one of them tried to hit on me.
3.07631E+17,you could start your very own indian family
2.22167E+17,I don't take pre-owned kids.
2.22167E+17,I prefer the new car smell of a fresh baby from my own nut
2.22167E+17,Not from Desi Chad's nut
2.22167E+17,I forgot the name for Indian Chad
2.22167E+17,The only single girl at my job was a clear weirdo. Like I swear she's going to be a cat lady
2.22167E+17,"Also, she owed like $70,000 in student loans, but bought a new Jeep."

4.09038E+17,"I was asked rotated arrays, Djikstras A*, and a virtual memory problem e.g. how would you design a virtual memory system for an OS with 1k pages"
4.09038E+17,But the last one is super uncommon and I was only asked that as part of my Surface interview cycle.
4.09038E+17,Oh and a design question where I walked through the implementation/design for a washing machine.
4.09038E+17,The last one was also super uncommon. I didn‚Äôt meet anyone else who had to do anything similar.
4.09038E+17,If you don‚Äôt have a copy of the CTCI you should pick one up. There‚Äôs an entire section on the Microsoft interview (it‚Äôs the easiest Big-N interview but focuses more on culture fit).
2.22167E+17,I won't be doing Microsoft anymore because they flaked. Google only
2.22167E+17,Either that or I land a job I'm completely unqualified for because I said I'd do it cheap
2.22167E+17,I think a company I applied to is seriously considering me for this job
2.22167E+17,I'm probably going to study that rotated arrays and Djikstra's MemeSearch at least. I've heard other comments on Reddit and YouTube saying those questions do come up in Google.
2.22167E+17,"that OS question doesn't sound like a Google one. Even their own tips page doesn't mention that stuff. System Design is possible, but I've heard it's asked to more experienced programmers. I only know how to copy and paste from StackOverflow and James"

1.96734E+17,in interviews
5.00413E+17,"Yeah I was interviewing for a fucking senior position at AMD and I think fizzbuzz was the first thing they asked. It got a lot more complicated afterwards but I was like "".... What?"""

5.00413E+17,"Like, do you want me to do this in multiple threads? Or like, quantum compute it or something?? No? Just fizz buzz? Okay...."

6.47265E+17,"Hi, Forcepoint Recruiter, 

I am applying for the software engineering summer internship position that is listed on the Indeed job search website.  I believe my programming and team-work skills acquired from college make me an ideal candidate.

Last semester in college, I had a great deal of development team experience.  I worked on collaborative team projects where each project used Github and a different programming language.  In particular, I felt most comfortable working on one of the projects with the Java programming language.  

Last summer, I studied abroad in the United Kingdom.  The study focused on computer architecture and organization.  I  learned the basics of the ARMv8 assembly language, and how computers use pipe-lining to speed up instruction execution.  Towards the end of the study, I created a single cycle processor using Verilog, a hardware descriptive language. 

I believe I will be an asset to your internship program.  I will assist your development team while expanding my skills as a software developer and team member.

Thank you for your consideration,

Sincerely,
Connor Bessell



I am most comfortable working in a Linux OS.  Specifically, I have been using Ubuntu as my primary OS for 3 years.  I prefer to edit/create programs in VIM, and compile programs via the command line.  I recently switched from a DOS like editor called Geany to VIM recently.  I am still learning how to maximize my efficiency with VIM, however I am enjoying VIM more than any editor I have used in the past."
